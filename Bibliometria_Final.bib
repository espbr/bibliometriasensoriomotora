abstract={Ageing has been suggested to affect sensorimotor adaptation by impairing explicit strategy use. Here we recorded electrophysiological (EEG) responses during visuomotor rotation in both young (n = 24) and older adults (n = 25), to investigate the neural processes that underpin putative age-related effects on adaptation. We measured the feedback related negativity (FRN) and the P3 in response to task-feedback, as electrophysiological markers of task error processing and outcome evaluation. The two age groups adapted similarly and showed comparable after effects and savings when re-exposed to the same perturbation several days after the initial session. Older adults, however, had less distinct EEG responses (i.e., reduced FRN amplitudes) to negative and positive task feedback. The P3 did not differ between age groups. Both young and older adults also showed a sustained late positivity following task feedback. Measured at the frontal electrode Fz, this sustained activity was negatively associated with both the amount of voluntary disengagement of explicit strategy and savings. In conclusion, despite preserved task performance, we find clear differences in neural responses to errors in older people, which suggests that there is a fundamental decline in this aspect of sensorimotor brain function with age. © 2020 IBRO},

abstract={A hallmark feature of speech motor control is its ability to learn to anticipate and compensate for persistent feedback alterations, a process referred to as sensorimotor adaptation. Because this process involves adjusting articulation to counter the perceived effects of altering acoustic feedback, there are a number of factors that affect it, including the complex relationship between acoustics and articulation and non-uniformities of speech perception. As a consequence, sensorimotor adaptation is hypothesised to vary as a function of the direction of the applied auditory feedback alteration in vowel formant space. This hypothesis was tested in two experiments where auditory feedback was altered in real time, shifting the frequency values of the first and second formants (F1 and F2) of participants' speech. Shifts were designed on a subject-by-subject basis and sensorimotor adaptation was quantified with respect to the direction of applied shift, normalised for individual speakers. Adaptation was indeed found to depend on the direction of the applied shift in vowel formant space, independent of shift magnitude. These findings have implications for models of sensorimotor adaptation of speech. © 2020 Author(s).},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between vocal pitch discrimination abilities and vocal responses to auditory pitch-shifts. Twenty children (6.6–11.7 years) and twenty adults (18–28 years) completed a listening task to determine auditory discrimination abilities to vocal fundamental frequency (fo) as well as two vocalization tasks in which their perceived fo was modulated in real-time. These pitch-shifts were either unexpected, providing information on auditory feedback control, or sustained, providing information on sensorimotor adaptation. Children were subdivided into two groups based on their auditory pitch discrimination abilities; children within two standard deviations of the adult group were classified as having adult-like discrimination abilities (N = 11), whereas children outside of this range were classified as having less sensitive discrimination abilities than adults (N = 9). Children with less sensitive auditory pitch discrimination abilities had significantly larger vocal response magnitudes to unexpected pitch-shifts and significantly smaller vocal response magnitudes to sustained pitch-shifts. Children with less sensitive auditory pitch discrimination abilities may rely more on auditory feedback and thus may be less adept at updating their stored motor programs. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Sensorimotor learning is thought to entail multiple learning processes, some volitional and others automatic. A new method to isolate implicit learning involves the use of a "clamped"visual perturbation in which, during a reaching movement, visual feedback is limited to a cursor that follows an invariant trajectory offset from the target by a fixed angle. Despite full awareness that the cursor movement is not contingent on their behavior, as well as explicit instructions to ignore the cursor, systematic changes in motor behavior are observed, and these changes have the signatures of motor adaptation observed in studies using classic visuomotor perturbations. Although it is clear that the response to clamped feedback occurs automatically, it remains unknown whether participants are sensitive to the large deviations in hand position that occur during adaptation. To address this question, we used the clamp method and asked participants to report their hand position after each reach. As expected, we observed robust deviations in hand angle away from the target (average of ~18°). The hand reports also showed systematic deviations over the course of adaptation, initially attracted toward the visual feedback and then in the opposite direction, paralleling the shift in hand position. However, the shift in perceived hand position was subtle, reaching only ~2° at asymptote. These results confirm that participants have limited awareness of the behavioral changes that occur during sensorimotor adaptation while revealing the impact of feedforward and feedback signals on their subjective experience. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Sensorimotor adaptation operates in an obligatory manner. Qualitatively, subjective reports obtained after adaptation demonstrate that, in many conditions, participants are unaware of significant changes in behavior. In the present study, we quantified participants' sensitivity to these adaptive changes by obtaining reports of hand position on a trial-by-trial basis. The results confirm that participants are largely unaware of adaptation but also reveal the subtle influence of feedback on their subjective experience.

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation—enduring changes to motor commands due to sensory feedback—allows speakers to match their articulations to intended speech acoustics. How the brain integrates auditory feedback to modify speech motor commands and what limits the degree of these modifications remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of speech motor cortex in modifying stored speech motor plans. In a within-subjects design, participants underwent separate sessions of sham and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over speech motor cortex while speaking and receiving altered auditory feedback of the first formant. Anodal tDCS increased the rate of sensorimotor adaptation for feedback perturbation. Computational modeling of our results using the Directions Into Velocities of Articulators (DIVA) framework of speech production suggested that tDCS primarily affected behavior by increasing the feedforward learning rate. This study demonstrates how focal noninvasive neurostimulation can enhance the integration of auditory feedback into speech motor plans. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recent clinical and neurobehavioral evidence suggests cerebellar dysfunction in schizophrenia (SZ). We used the prism adaptation motor task (PAT) to probe specific cerebellar circuits in the disorder. PAT requires cerebellum-dependent motor adaptation, perceptual remapping, and strategic control. A failure to engage in early corrective processes may indicate impairment within either the cerebellum or regions contributing to strategic components, such as the parietal lobe, while an inability to develop and retain a visuomotor shift with time strongly suggests cerebellar impairment. Thirty-one individuals with SZ and 31 individuals without a history of psychological disorders completed PAT. Subjects reached to a target before, during, and following prism exposure, while their movements were recorded using motion-sensing technology. The SZ group performed worse on conditions consisting of adaptation, post-adaptation, aftereffects, and reorientation, thereby demonstrating a failure to adapt to the same degree as healthy controls. SZ performance remained impaired even with visual feedback and did not differ from controls at baseline, suggesting the observed deficit is specific to adaptation. Results indicate that sensorimotor adaptation is impaired in SZ and implicate disturbances in cerebellar circuits. © The Author(s) 2020.

abstract={Purpose: Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is characterized by poor coordination and clumsiness in children. Subjects often show unsteady gait, frequent tripping, and difficulty holding objects. Here we evaluated the implicit and explicit motor learning capabilities of children with DCD. Method: We assessed a total of 80 children (4–12 years old). These children were divided into two groups of 40 participants each. One group with DCD diagnosis and a control group. Using a prism adaptation paradigm, we evaluated whether DCD affects procedural visuomotor adaptation. This adaptation typically occurs during the laterally displacing prism adaptation task. We contrasted these results with the performance during a reversing prism adaptation task, which mainly places demands on strategic visuomotor learning. To solve both adaptation tasks, subjects must perform the same movements, but using two completely different approaches. Results: There was a significant variable error difference between groups, confirming a motor control deficit in individuals with DCD. This group also showed significant visuomotor learning deficits in the displacing task, including less adaptation and smaller aftereffect. The analysis on the reversing task revealed a significant larger number of subjects with DCD that could not adapt, suggesting significant strategic visuomotor learning deficits in this group too. Conclusions: These results demonstrate procedural and strategic visuomotor deficits in this sample of children with DCD. © 2019 SHAPE America.},

abstract={Our understanding of the adaptive processes that shape sensorimotor behavior is largely derived from studying isolated movements. Studies of visuomotor adaptation, in which participants adapt cursor movements to rotations of the cursor’s screen position, have led to prominent theories of motor control. In response to changes in visual feedback of movements, explicit (cognitive) and implicit (automatic) learning processes adapt movements to counter errors. However, movements rarely occur in isolation. The extent to which explicit and implicit processes drive sensorimotor adaptation when multiple movements occur simultaneously, as in the real world, remains unclear. Here we address this problem in the context of speech and hand movements. Participants spoke in-time with rapid, hand-driven cursor movements. Using real-time alterations of vowel sound feedback, and visual rotations of the cursor’s screen position, we induced sensorimotor adaptation in one or both movements simultaneously. Across three experiments (n = 60, n = 48 and n = 76, respectively), we demonstrate that visuomotor adaptation is markedly impaired by simultaneous speech adaptation, and the impairment is specific to the explicit learning process in visuomotor adaptation. In contrast, visuomotor adaptation had no impact on speech adaptation. The results demonstrate that the explicit learning process in visuomotor adaptation is sensitive to movements in other motor domains. They suggest that some forms of speech adaptation may lack an explicit learning process altogether. © 2020, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract={The adaption of movement to changes in the environment varies across life span. Recent evidence has linked motor adaptation and its reduction with age to differences in “explicit” learning processes. We examine differences in brain structure and cognition underlying motor adaptation in a population-based cohort (n = 322, aged 18–89 years) using a visuomotor learning task and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Reduced motor adaptation with age was associated with reduced volume in striatum, prefrontal, and sensorimotor cortical regions, but not cerebellum. Medial temporal lobe volume, including the hippocampus, became a stronger determinant of motor adaptation with age. Consistent with the role of the medial temporal lobes, declarative long-term memory showed a similar interaction, whereby memory was more positively correlated with motor adaptation with increasing age. By contrast, visual short-term memory was related to motor adaptation, independently of age. These results support the hypothesis that cerebellar learning is largely unaffected in old age, and the reduction in motor adaptation with age is driven by a decline in explicit memory systems. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={In sensorimotor adaptation paradigms, participants learn to adjust their behavior in response to an external perturbation. Locomotor adaptation and reaching adaptation depend on the cerebellum and are accompanied by changes in functional connectivity in cortico-cerebellar circuits. In order to gain a better understanding of the particular cerebellar projections involved in locomotor adaptation, we assessed the contribution of specific white matter pathways to the magnitude of locomotor adaptation and to long-term motor adaptation effects (recall and relearning). Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging with deterministic tractography was used to delineate the inferior and superior cerebellar peduncles (ICP, SCP) and the corticospinal tract (CST). Correlations were calculated to assess the association between the diffusivity values along the tracts and behavioral measures of locomotor adaptation. The results point to a significant correlation between the magnitude of adaptation and diffusivity values in the left ICP. Specifically, a higher magnitude of adaptation was associated with higher mean diffusivity and with lower anisotropy values in the left ICP, but not in other pathways. Post hoc analysis revealed that the effect stems from radial, not axial, diffusivity. The magnitude of adaptation was further associated with the degree of ICP lateralization, such that greater adaptation magnitude was correlated with increased rightward asymmetry of the ICP. Our findings suggest that the magnitude of locomotor adaptation depends on afferent signals to the cerebellum, transmitted via the ICP, and point to the contribution of error detection to locomotor adaptation rate. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The human nervous system displays such plasticity that we can adapt our motor behavior to various changes in environmental or body properties. However, how sensorimotor adaptation generalizes to new situations and new effectors, and which factors influence the underlying mechanisms, remains unclear. Here we tested the general hypothesis that differences across participants can be exploited to uncover what drives interlimb transfer. Twenty healthy adults adapted to prismatic glasses while reaching to visual targets with their dominant arm. Classic adaptation and generalization across movement directions were observed but transfer to the non-dominant arm was not significant and inter-individual differences were substantial. Interlimb transfer resulted for some participants in a directional shift of non-dominant arm movements that was consistent with an encoding of visuomotor adaptation in extrinsic coordinates. For some other participants, transfer was consistent with an intrinsic coordinate system. Simple and multiple regression analyses showed that a few kinematic parameters such as peak acceleration (or peak velocity) and variability of movement direction were correlated with interlimb transfer. Low peak acceleration and low variability were related to extrinsic transfer, while high peak acceleration and high variability were related to intrinsic transfer. Motor variability was also positively correlated with the magnitude of the after-effect systematically observed on the dominant arm. Overall, these findings on unconstrained movements support the idea that individual movement features could be linked to the sensorimotor adaptation and its generalization. The study also suggests that distinct movement characteristics may be related to different coordinate frames of action representations in the nervous system. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Little is known about the impact of attention during motor adaptation tasks on how movements adapted in one context generalize to another. We investigated this by manipulating subjects' attention to their movements while exposing them to split-belt walking (i.e., legs moving at different speeds), which is known to induce locomotor adaptation. We hypothesized that reducing subjects' attention to their movements by distracting them as they adapted their walking pattern would facilitate the generalization of recalibrated movements beyond the training environment. We reasoned that awareness of the novel split-belt condition could be used to consciously contextualize movements to that particular situation. To test this hypothesis, young adults adapted their gait on a split-belt treadmill while they observed visual information that either distracted them or made them aware of the belt's speed difference. We assessed adaptation and aftereffects of spatial and temporal gait features known to adapt and generalize differently in different environments. We found that all groups adapted similarly by reaching the same steady-state values for all gait parameters at the end of the adaptation period. In contrast, both groups with altered attention to the split-belts environment (distraction and awareness groups) generalized their movements from the treadmill to overground more than controls, who walked without altered attention. This was specifically observed in the generalization of step time (temporal gait feature), which might be less susceptible to online corrections during walking overground. These results suggest that altering attention to one's movements during sensorimotor adaptation facilitates the generalization of movement recalibration. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Little is known about how attention affects the generalization of motor recalibration induced by sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. We showed that altering attention to movements on a split-belt treadmill led to greater adaptation effects in subjects walking overground. Thus our results suggest that altering patients' attention to their actions during sensorimotor adaptation protocols could lead to greater generalization of corrected movements when moving without the training device.

abstract={Prospective evidence indicates that functional biomechanics and brain connectivity may predispose an athlete to an anterior cruciate ligament injury, revealing novel neural linkages for targeted neuromuscular training interventions. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a real-time biofeedback system for altering knee biomechanics and brain functional connectivity. Seventeen healthy, young, physically active female athletes completed 6 weeks of augmented neuromuscular training (aNMT) utilizing real-time, interactive visual biofeedback and 13 served as untrained controls. A drop vertical jump and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging were separately completed at pre- and posttest time points to assess sensorimotor adaptation. The aNMT group had a significant reduction in peak knee abduction moment (pKAM) compared to controls (p =.03, d = 0.71). The aNMT group also exhibited a significant increase in functional connectivity between the right supplementary motor area and the left thalamus (p =.0473 after false discovery rate correction). Greater percent change in pKAM was also related to increased connectivity between the right cerebellum and right thalamus for the aNMT group (p =.0292 after false discovery rate correction, r2 =.62). No significant changes were observed for the controls (ps &gt;.05). Our data provide preliminary evidence of potential neural mechanisms for aNMT-induced motor adaptations that reduce injury risk. Future research is warranted to understand the role of neuromuscular training alone and how each component of aNMT influences biomechanics and functional connectivity. © 2020 Society for Psychophysiological Research},

abstract={The way we can correct our ongoing movements to sudden and unforeseen perturbations is key to our ability to rapidly adjust our behavior to novel environmental demands. Referred to as sensorimotor flexibility, this ability can be assessed by the double-step paradigm in which participants must correct their ongoing arm movements to reach targets that unexpectedly change location (i.e., target jump). While this type of corrections has been demonstrated in normogravity in the extent of reasonable spatiotemporal constraints underpinning the target jumps, less is known about sensorimotor flexibility in altered gravitational force fields. We thus aimed to assess sensorimotor flexibility by comparing online arm pointing corrections observed during microgravity episodes of parabolic flights with normogravity standards. Seven participants were asked to point as fast and as accurately as possible toward one of two visual targets with their right index finger. The targets were aligned vertically in the mid-sagittal plane and were separated by 10 cm. In 20% of the trials, the initially illuminated lower target was switched off at movement onset while the upper target was concomitantly switched on prompting participants to change the trajectory of their ongoing movements. Results showed that, both in normogravity and microgravity, participants successfully performed the pointing task including when the target jumped unexpectedly (i.e., comparable success rate). Most importantly, no significant difference was found in target jump trials regarding arm kinematics between both gravitational environments, neither in terms of peak velocity, relative deceleration duration, peak acceleration or time to peak acceleration. Using inverse dynamics based on experimental and anthropometrical data, we demonstrated that the shoulder torques for accelerating and decelerating the vertical arm movements substantially differed between microgravity and normogravity. Our data therefore highlight the capacity of the central nervous system to perform very fast neuromuscular adjustments that are adapted to the gravitational constraints.

abstract={Prism adaptation (PA) is a technique that induces a temporary change of the alignment between different reference frames. This technique has been shown to reduce many signs of unilateral spatial neglect (USN). Two procedures of prism adaptation have been used. In concurrent exposure participants can see their arm and hand during the movement trajectory, and during terminal exposure, participants can see only the most distal few centimetres. Because the two exposures elicit different proportions of visual and proprioceptive realignment, they could present different rehabilitation efficacies. We compared these procedures in 12 USN patients and 12 healthy participants who performed one session of PA with concurrent exposure and one session with terminal exposure. We compared the effects of the two exposure types on sensorimotor outcomes (visual subjective straight ahead, proprioceptive subjective straight ahead, open loop pointing, and error correction during exposure) and neglect outcomes. We found no significant differences in the effects of the two exposure types on sensorimotor performance of patients and controls, nor on patients’ neuropsychological outcomes. Compared with controls, USN patients showed a significant rightward bias in visual subjective straight ahead pre-adaptation, a slower rate of error correction during prism exposure, and some evidence that visual and proprioceptive shift could be influenced by their neglect. Based on these results, we recommend that prism adaptation be conducted with concurrent exposure for easiness of execution. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Traditional views of sensorimotor adaptation (i.e., adaptation of movements to perturbed sensory feedback) emphasize the role of automatic, implicit correction of sensory prediction errors. However, latent memories formed during sensorimotor adaptation, manifest as improved relearning (e.g., savings), have recently been attributed to strategic corrections of task errors (failures to achieve task goals). To dissociate contributions of task errors and sensory prediction errors to latent sensorimotor memories, we perturbed target locations to remove or enforce task errors during learning and/or test, with male/female human participants. Adaptation improved after learning in all conditions where participants were permitted to correct task errors, and did not improve whenever we prevented correction of task errors. Thus, previous correction of task errors was both necessary and sufficient to improve adaptation. In contrast, a history of sensory prediction errors was neither sufficient nor obligatory for improved adaptation. Limiting movement preparation time showed that the latent memories driven by learning to correct task errors take at least two forms: a time-consuming but flexible component, and a rapidly expressible, inflexible component. The results provide strong support for the idea that movement corrections driven by a failure to successfully achieve movement goals underpin motor memories that manifest as savings. Such persistent memories are not exclusively mediated by time-consuming strategic processes but also comprise a rapidly expressible but inflexible component. The distinct characteristics of these putative processes suggest dissociable underlying mechanisms, and imply that identification of the neural basis for adaptation and savings will require methods that allow such dissociations.

abstract={Visually guided movements can show surprising accuracy even when the perceived three-dimensional (3D) shape of the target is distorted. One explanation of this paradox is that an evolutionarily specialized “vision-for-action” system provides accurate shape estimates by relying selectively on stereo information and ignoring less reliable sources of shape information like texture and shading. However, the key support for this hypothesis has come from studies that analyze average behavior across many visuomotor interactions where available sensory feedback reinforces stereo information. The present study, which carefully accounts for the effects of feedback, shows that visuomotor interactions with slanted surfaces are actually planned using the same cue-combination function as slant perception and that apparent dissociations can arise due to two distinct supervised learning processes: sensorimotor adaptation and cue reweighting. In two experiments, we show that when a distorted slant cue biases perception (e.g., surfaces appear flattened by a fixed amount), sensorimotor adaptation rapidly adjusts the planned grip orientation to compensate for this constant error. However, when the distorted slant cue is unreliable, leading to variable errors across a set of objects (i.e., some slants are overestimated, others underestimated), then relative cue weights are gradually adjusted to reduce the misleading effect of the unreliable cue, consistent with previous perceptual studies of cue reweighting. The speed and flexibility of these two forms of learning provide an alternative explanation of why perception and action are sometimes found to be dissociated in experiments where some 3D shape cues are consistent with sensory feedback while others are faulty. NEW & NOTEWORTHY When interacting with three-dimensional (3D) objects, sensory feedback is available that could improve future performance via supervised learning. Here we confirm that natural visuomotor interactions lead to sensorimotor adaptation and cue reweighting, two distinct learning processes uniquely suited to resolve errors caused by biased and noisy 3D shape cues. These findings explain why perception and action are often found to be dissociated in experiments where some cues are consistent with sensory feedback while others are faulty.

abstract={From reaching to walking, real-life experience suggests that people can generalize between motor behaviors. One possible explanation for this generalization is that real-life behaviors often challenge our balance. We propose that the exacerbated body motions associated with balance-challenged whole body movements increase the value to the nervous system of using a comprehensive internal model to control the task. Because it is less customized to a specific task, a more comprehensive model is also a more generalizable model. Here we tested the hypothesis that challenging balance during adaptation would increase generalization of a newly learned internal model. We encouraged participants to learn a new internal model using prism lenses that created a new visuomotor mapping. Four groups of participants adapted to prisms while performing either a standing-based reaching or precision walking task, with or without a manipulation that challenged balance. To assess generalization after the adaptation phase, participants performed a single trial of each of the other groups’ tasks without prisms. We found that both the reaching and walking balance-challenged groups showed significantly greater generalization to the equivalent, nonadapted task than the balance-unchallenged groups. Additionally, we found some evidence that all groups generalized across tasks, for example, from walking to reaching and vice versa, regardless of balance manipulation. Overall, our results demonstrate that challenging balance increases the degree to which a newly learned internal model generalizes to untrained movements. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Real-life experience indicates that people can generalize between motor behaviors. Here we show that challenging balance during the learning of a new internal model increases the degree of generalization to untrained movements for both reaching and walking tasks. These results suggest that the effects of challenging balance are not specific to the task but instead apply to motor learning more broadly. Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society},

abstract={Previous research suggests that so-called implicit and explicit processes of motor adaptation are implemented by distinct neural structures. Here we tested whether implicit sensorimotor adaptation and strategic re-aiming used to reduce movement error are reflected by spatially distinct EEG oscillatory components. We analyzed beta-band oscillations (∼13-30 Hz), which have long been linked to sensorimotor functions, at the time when these adaptive processes intervene for movement planning. We hypothesized that beta-band activity within sensorimotor regions relates to implicit adaptive processes, whereas beta-band activity within medial motor areas reflects deliberate re-aiming. In female and male human volunteers, we recorded EEG in a motor adaptation task in which a visual rotation was introduced in short series of trials separated by unperturbed trials. Participants were instructed in advance about the nature of the visual perturbation and trained to counter it by strategically re-aiming at a neighboring target. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that preparatory beta-band activities within the two regions exhibited different patterns of modulation. Beta power in lateral central regions was attenuated when a change in the visual condition rendered internal-model predictions uncertain. In contrast, beta power in medial frontal regions was selectively decreased when participants strategically re-aimed their reaches. We propose that the reduction in lateral central beta power reflects an increased weighting of peripheral sensory information implicitly triggered when an adaptive change in the sensorimotor mapping is required, whereas the reduction in medial frontal beta-band activity relates to the inhibition of automatic motor responses in favor of cognitively controlled movements. © 2020 the authors.},

abstract={The motor system has the flexibility to update motor plans according to systematic changes in the environment or the body. This capacity is studied in the laboratory through sensorimotor adaptation paradigms imposing sustained and predictable motor demands specific to the task at hand. However, these studies are tied to the laboratory setting. Thus, we asked if a portable device could be used to elicit locomotor adaptation outside the laboratory. To this end, we tested the extent to which a pair of motorized shoes could induce similar locomotor adaptation to split-belt walking, which is a well-established sensorimotor adaptation paradigm in locomotion. We specifically compared the adaptation effects (i.e. after-effects) between two groups of young, healthy participants walking with the legs moving at different speeds by either a split-belt treadmill or a pair of motorized shoes. The speeds at which the legs moved in the split-belt group was set by the belt speed under each foot, whereas in the motorized shoes group were set by the combined effect of the actuated shoes and the belts’ moving at the same speed. We found that the adaptation of joint motions and measures of spatial and temporal asymmetry, which are commonly used to quantify sensorimotor adaptation in locomotion, were indistinguishable between groups. We only found small differences in the joint angle kinematics during baseline walking between the groups – potentially due to the weight and height of the motorized shoes. Our results indicate that robust sensorimotor adaptation in walking can be induced with a paired of motorized shoes, opening the exciting possibility to study sensorimotor adaptation during more realistic situations outside the laboratory. © Copyright © 2020 Aucie, Zhang, Sargent and Torres-Oviedo.},

abstract={Purpose Coordination and coordination variability have been used as a measure of the function and flexibility of the sensorimotor system during running. Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is associated with altered sensorimotor system function compared with individuals without CAI. Copers may have adopted protective sensorimotor adaptations to prevent repeated ankle sprains; however, their coordination strategies between the foot and shank have not been investigated. We compared joint coupling angles and coordination variability using vector coding between individuals with CAI, copers, and controls. Methods Seventeen individuals with CAI, 17 copers, and 17 controls ran on the treadmill at a fixed speed of 2.68 m·s-1. A 10-s trial of continuous data was collected for kinematic analysis. The first five complete strides were used for vector coding. Means of the vector coding angles and variability of frontal plane ankle motion/transverse plane tibia motion and sagittal plane ankle motion/transverse plane tibia motion (SAK/TT) were calculated. A curve analysis with 90% confidence intervals was performed to detect differences between groups. Results Controls demonstrated greater angles of SAK/TT than individuals with CAI and greater angles of FAK/TT than copers during the second half of stance. In general, the control group demonstrated greater variability than individuals with CAI and copers, and copers demonstrated greater variability than individuals with CAI. Conclusions Chronic ankle instability and copers demonstrated different coordination strategies than controls during loading and propulsion, adding evidence to support a sensorimotor deficit or compensation. Further, limited variability in people with history of CAI during impact and midstance may contribute to higher risk of reinjury, and be an important area for further research. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

abstract={Talkers have been shown to adapt the production of multiple vowel sounds simultaneously in response to altered auditory feedback. The present study extends this work by exploring the adaptation of speech production to a physical alteration of the vocal tract involving a palatal prosthesis that impacts both somatosensory and auditory feedback during the production of a range of consonants and vowels. Acoustic and kinematic measures of the tongue were used to examine the impact of the physical perturbation across the various speech sounds, and to assess learned changes following 20 min of speech practice involving the production of complex, variable sentences. As in prior studies, acoustic analyses showed perturbation and adaptation effects primarily for sounds directly involving interaction with the palate. Analyses of tongue kinematics, however, revealed systematic, robust effects of the perturbation and subsequent motor learning across the full range of speech sounds. The results indicate that speakers are able to reconfigure oral motor patterns during the production of multiple speech sounds spanning the articulatory workspace following a physical alteration of the vocal tract. © 2020 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Human movements are flexible as they continuously adapt to changes in the environment. The recalibration of corrective responses to sustained perturbations (e.g., constant force) altering one’s movement contributes to this flexibility. We asked whether the recalibration of corrective actions involve cerebral structures using stroke as a disease model. We characterized changes in muscle activity in stroke survivors and control subjects be-fore, during, and after walking on a split-belt treadmill moving the legs at different speeds. The recalibration of corrective muscle activity was comparable between stroke survivors and control subjects, which was unexpected given the known deficits in feedback responses poststroke. Also, the intact recalibration in stroke survivors contrasted their limited ability to adjust their muscle activity during steady-state split-belt walking. Our results suggest that the recalibration and execution of motor commands are partially dissociable: cerebral le-sions interfere with the execution, but not the recalibration, of motor commands on novel movement demands. © 2020, Society for Neuroscience.

abstract={Intermittent exposure to a sensorimotor perturbation, such as a visuomotor rotation, is known to cause a directional bias on the subsequent movement that opposes the previously experienced perturbation. To date, it is unclear whether the parietal cortex is causally involved in this postperturbation movement bias. In a recent electroencephalogram study, Savoie et al. (2018) observed increased parietal activity in response to an intermittent visuomotor perturbation, raising the possibility that the parietal cortex could subserve this change in motor behavior. The goal of the present study was to causally test this hypothesis. Human participants (N = 28) reached toward one of two visual targets located on either side of a fixation point, while being pseu-dorandomly submitted to a visuomotor rotation. On half of all rotation trials, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied over the right (N = 14) or left (N = 14) parietal cortex 150 ms after visual feedback provision. To determine whether TMS influenced the postperturbation bias, reach direction was compared on trials that followed rotation with (RS 1 1) and without (R 1 1) TMS. It was hypothesized that interfering with parietal activity would reduce the movement bias following rotated trials. Results revealed a significant and robust postrotation directional bias compared with both rotation and null rotation trials. Contrary to our hy-pothesis, however, neither left nor right parietal stimulation significantly impacted the postrotation bias. These data suggest that the parietal areas targeted here may not be critical for perturbation-induced motor output changes to emerge. © 2020 Savoie et al.},

abstract={The hallmark of long-term retention of sensorimotor adaptation is a faster relearning when similar perturbations are encountered again. However, what processes underlie this saving effect is in debate. Though motor adaptation is traditionally viewed as a type of procedural learning, its savings has been recently shown to be solely based on a quick recall of explicit adaptation strategy. Here, we showed that adaptation to a novel error-invariant perturbation without an explicit strategy could enable subsequent savings. We further showed that adaptation to gradual perturbations could enable savings, which was supported by enhanced implicit learning. Our study provides supporting evidence that long-term retention of motor adaptation is possible without forming or recalling a cognitive strategy, and the interplay between implicit and explicit learning critically depends on the specifics of learning protocol and available sensory feedback. © 2020 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Motor adaptation, the adjustment of a motor output in face of changes in the environment, may operate at different rates. When human participants encounter repeated or consistent perturbations, their corrections for the experienced errors are larger compared with when the perturbations are new or inconsistent. Such modulations of error sensitivity were traditionally considered to be an implicit process that does not require attentional resources. In recent years, the implicit view of motor adaptation has been challenged by evidence showing a contribution of explicit strategies to learning. These findings raise a fundamental question regarding the nature of the error sensitivity modulation processes. We tested the effect of explicit control on error sensitivity in a series of experiments, in which participants controlled a screen cursor to virtual targets. We manipulated environmental consistency by presenting rotations in random (low consistency) or random walk (high consistency) sequences and illustrated that perturbation consistency affects the rate of adaptation, corroborating previous studies. When participants were instructed to ignore the cursor and move directly to the target, thus eliminating the contribution of explicit strategies, consistency-driven error sensitivity modulation was not detected. In addition, delaying the visual feedback, a manipulation that affects implicit learning, did not influence error sensitivity under consistent perturbations. These results suggest that increases of learning rate in consistent environments are attributable to an explicit rather than implicit process in sensorimotor adaptation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The consistency of an external perturbation modulates error sensitivity and the motor response. The roles of explicit and implicit processes in this modulation are unknown. We show that when humans are asked to ignore the perturbation, they do not show increased error sensitivity in consistent environments. When the implicit system is manipulated by delaying feedback, sensitivity to a consistent perturbation does not change. Overall, our results suggest that consistency affects adaptation mainly through explicit control. Copyright © 2020 the American Physiological Society},

abstract={The present study addresses how task constraints and aging influence isometric force control. We used two tasks requiring either force maintenance (straight line target force) or force modulation (sine-wave target force) around different force levels and at different modulation frequencies. Force levels were defined relative the individual maximum voluntary contraction. A group of young adults (mean age ± SD = 25 ± 3.6 years) and a group of elderly (mean age = 77 ± 6.4 years) took part in the study. Age- and task-related effects were assessed through differences in: (i) force control accuracy, (ii) time-structure of force fluctuations, and (iii) the contribution of deterministic (predictable) and stochastic (noise-like) dynamic components to the expressed behavior. Performance-wise, the elderly showed a pervasive lower accuracy and higher variability than the young participants. The analysis of fluctuations showed that the elderly produced force signals that were less complex than those of the young adults during the maintenance task, but the reverse was observed in the modulation task. Behavioral complexity results suggest a reduced adaptability to task-constraints with advanced age. Regarding the dynamics, we found comparable generating mechanisms in both age groups for both tasks and in all conditions, namely a fixed-point for force maintenance and a limit-cycle for force modulation. However, aging increased the stochasticity (noise-driven fluctuations) of force fluctuations in the cyclic force modulation, which could be related to the increased complexity found in elderly for this same task. To our knowledge this is the first time that these different perspectives to motor control are used simultaneously to characterize force control capacities. Our findings show their complementarity in revealing distinct aspects of sensorimotor adaptation to task constraints and age-related declines. Although further research is still needed to identify the physiological underpinnings, the used task and methodology are shown to have both fundamental and clinical applications.

abstract={How is the complex audiomotor skill of speaking learned? To what extent does it depend on the specific characteristics of the vocal tract? Here, we developed a touchscreen-based speech synthesizer to examine learning of speech production independent of the vocal tract. Participants were trained to reproduce heard vowel targets by reaching to locations on the screen without visual feedback and receiving endpoint vowel sound auditory feedback that depended continuously on touch location. Participants demonstrated learning as evidenced by rapid increases in accuracy and consistency in the production of trained targets. This learning generalized to productions of novel vowel targets. Subsequent to learning, sensorimotor adaptation was observed in response to changes in the location-sound mapping. These findings suggest that participants learned adaptable sensorimotor maps allowing them to produce desired vowel sounds. These results have broad implications for understanding the acquisition of speech motor control. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={A single exercise bout has been found to improve the retention of a skill-based upper extremity motor task up to a week post-practice. This effect is the greatest when exercise intensity is high and exercise is administered immediately after motor practice (i.e., early in consolidation). Whether exercise can affect other motor learning types (e.g., sensorimotor adaptation) and tasks (e.g., walking) is still unclear as previous studies have not optimally refined the exercise parameters and long-term retention testing. Therefore, we investigated whether a single high-intensity exercise bout during early consolidation would improve the long-term retention and relearning of sensorimotor adaptation during split-belt treadmill walking. Twenty-six neurologically intact adults attended three sessions; sessions 2 and 3 were 1 day and 7 days after session 1, respectively. Participants were allocated either to Rest (REST) or to Exercise (EXE) group. In session 1, all groups walked on a split-belt treadmill in a 2:1 speed ratio (1.5:0.75 m/s). Then, half of the participants exercised for 5 min (EXE), while the other half rested for 5 min (REST). A short exercise bout during early consolidation did not improve retention or relearning of locomotor memories one or seven days after session 1. This result reinforces previous findings that the effect of exercise on motor learning may differ between sensorimotor locomotor adaptation and skilled-based upper extremity tasks; thus, the utility of exercise as a behavioral booster of motor learning may depend on the type of motor learning and task. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The contribution of the motor system to perception has been highlighted in research investigating the effect of performing an action on the conscious processing of information received from the sensory systems. For example, the perceptual temporal asynchrony observed when passively reporting changes in visual object attributes (e.g., colour and position) was found to disappear virtually when the changes resulted from a voluntary motor action. Although the spatio-temporal constraints of sensory binding by action have been broadly investigated, the underlying neural correlates are still largely unknown. In the present study, participants performed temporal order judgments of changes in the colour and position of a visual stimulus, while adapting to a 750 ms delay between a sound (perceptual condition) or the end of a manual reaching action (motor condition), and the visual changes. Behavioural observations indicated that temporal asynchrony (-30.2 ms) decreased in the motor condition (2.7 ms), as a result of sensorimotor adaptation, but not in the perceptual condition (-29.6 ms). EEG-evoked potentials on posterior visual regions showed that early components were altered by sensorimotor adaptation, with in particular a broad reduction in the amplitude of the early P1 component. Furthermore, time-frequency analysis of EEG signals during the 350 ms period preceding the visual changes revealed an increase of the 15–25 Hz frequency band amplitude in the central region and a decrease of the 8–12 Hz frequency band amplitude in the posterior region. Overall the results suggest that sensory binding by action depends on an early top-down modulation of the visual regions by the motor system - in agreement with the pre-activation theory of action-perception coupling - associated with an increase of attentional resources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Understanding gait adaptation is essential for rehabilitation, and visual feedback can be used during gait rehabilitation to develop effective gait training. We have previously shown that subjects can adapt spatial aspects of walking to an implicitly imposed distortion of visual feedback of step length. To further investigate the storage benefit of an implicit process engaged in visual feedback distortion, we compared the robustness of aftereffects acquired by visual feedback distortion, versus split-belt treadmill walking. For the visual distortion trial, we implicitly distorted the visual representation of subjects’ gait symmetry, whereas for the split-belt trial, the speed ratio of the two belts was gradually adjusted without visual feedback. After adaptation, the visual feedback or the split-belt perturbation was removed while subjects continued walking, and aftereffects of preserved asymmetric pattern were assessed. We found that subjects trained with visual distortion trial retained aftereffects longest. In response to the larger speed ratio of split-belt walking, the subjects showed an increase in the size of aftereffects compared to the smaller speed ratio, but it steeply decreased over time in all the speed ratios tested. In contrast, the visual distortion group showed much slower decreasing rate of aftereffects, which was evidence of longer storage of an adapted gait pattern. Visual distortion adaptation may involve the interaction and integration of the change in motor strategy and implicit process in sensorimotor adaptation. Although it should be clarified more clearly through further studies, the findings of this study suggest that gait control employs distinct adaptive processes during the visual distortion and split-belt walking and also the level of reliance of an implicit process may be greater in the visual distortion adaptation than the split-belt walking adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Split-belt treadmills that move the legs at different speeds are thought to update internal representations of the environment, such that this novel condition generates a new locomotor pattern with distinct spatio-temporal features compared to those of regular walking. It is unclear the degree to which such recalibration of movements in the spatial and temporal domains is interdependent. In this study, we explicitly altered subjects' limb motion in either space or time during split-belt walking to determine its impact on the adaptation of the other domain. Interestingly, we observed that motor adaptation in the spatial domain was susceptible to altering the temporal domain, whereas motor adaptation in the temporal domain was resilient to modifying the spatial domain. This non-reciprocal relation suggests a hierarchical organization such that the control of timing in locomotion has an effect on the control of limb position. This is of translational interest because clinical populations often have a greater deficit in one domain compared to the other. Our results suggest that explicit changes to temporal deficits cannot occur without modifying the spatial control of the limb. © 2019 Gonzalez-Rubio, Velasquez and Torres-Oviedo.},

abstract={Despite changes in the physical structures controlling the eyes, saccades, the rapid eye movements used to explore the visual environment, remain accurate throughout the lifetime. The process underlying this sensorimotor adaptation is studied using a double step paradigm: an intra-saccadic target displacement introduces a systematic position error which triggers changes in saccadic amplitude or direction across trials. Numerous researches on this saccade adaptation have been conducted, but the level of inter-individual variability and consistency in saccade gain change and how it relates to increase- or decrease-amplitude paradigms is not fully described. We conducted experiments in four groups of 25 participants with 800 trials per participant, including 200 baseline trials and 200 recovery trials. We used four distinct double-step paradigms that differed by the intra-saccadic target-step leading to either a horizontal (Backward or Forward) or vertical (Upward or Downward) gain modulation. Across experiments 95% of the participants exhibited adaptation, revealing the consistency of this phenomenon. We observed strong inter-individual differences, both in the extent and rate of adaptation, which were not correlated with the individual baseline saccades characteristics. As previously reported, the rates of adaptation were higher for gain decrease than for gain increase experiments but the final extent of adaptation were similar. Our results also support the view that adaptation of oblique saccades occurs where the saccade command is represented as a vector. Finally, at the individual level, we did not observe systematic changes in the saccade metrics in relation to adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Motor learning has been shown to decline in healthy aging, particularly in the early stages of acquisition. There is now ample evidence that motor learning relies on multiple interacting learning processes that operate on different timescales, but the specific cognitive mechanisms that contribute to motor learning remain unclear. Working memory resources appear to be particularly important during the early stages of motor learning, and declines in early motor learning have been associated with working memory performance in older adults. We examined whether age differences in the early stages of motor learning could be reduced or eliminated by reducing the spatial working memory demands during a force-field adaptation task. Groups of younger and older adults made center-out reaching movements to spatial targets either in a repeating four-element sequence, or in a random order. Participants also performed a battery of cognitive tests to further investigate the potential involvement of associative memory, spatial working memory, and procedural learning mechanisms in the early stage of motor learning. Although all groups adapted their movements equally well by the end of the learning phase, older adults only adapted as quickly as younger adults in the sequence condition, with the older adults in the random group exhibiting slower learning in the earliest stage of motor learning. Across all participants, early motor learning performance was correlated with recognition memory performance on an associative memory test. Within the younger random group, who were able to adapt as quickly as the sequence groups, early motor learning performance was also correlated with performance on a test of procedural learning. These findings suggest that age differences in early stages of motor learning can be eliminated if the spatial working memory demands involved in a motor learning task are limited. Moreover, the results suggest that multiple cognitive resources may be utilized during the early stage of learning, and younger adults may be more flexible than older adults in the recruitment of additional cognitive resources to support learning when spatial working memory demands are high. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can enhance cognitive function in healthy individuals, with promising applications as a therapeutic intervention. Despite this potential, variability in the efficacy of tDCS has been a considerable concern. Objective: /Hypothesis: Given that tDCS is always applied at a set intensity, we examined whether individual differences in sensitivity to brain stimulation might be one variable that modulates the efficacy of tDCS in a motor learning task. Methods: In the first part of the experiment, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over primary motor cortex (M1) was used to determine each participant's resting motor threshold (rMT). This measure was used as a proxy of individual sensitivity to brain stimulation. In an experimental group of 28 participants, 2 mA tDCS was then applied during a motor learning task with the anodal electrode positioned over left M1. Another 14 participants received sham stimulation. Results: M1-Anodal tDCS facilitated learning relative to participants who received sham stimulation. Of primary interest was a within-group analysis of the experimental group, showing that the rate of learning was positively correlated with rMT: Participants who were more sensitive to brain stimulation as operationalized by our TMS proxy (low rMT), showed faster adaptation. Conclusions: Methodologically, the results indicate that TMS sensitivity can predict tDCS efficacy in a behavioral task, providing insight into one source of variability that may contribute to replication problems with tDCS. Theoretically, the results provide further evidence of a role of sensorimotor cortex in adaptation, with the boost from tDCS observed during acquisition. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={After-effects following sensorimotor adaptation are generally considered as evidence for the formation of an internal model, although evidence lacks on whether the absence of after-effects necessarily indicates that the adaptation did not result in the formation of an internal model. Here, we examined direct- and after-effects of dynamic adaptation with one arm at one workspace on subsequent performance with the other arm, as well as the same arm at another workspace. During training, subjects performed reaching movements under a novel dynamic condition with the right arm; during testing, they performed reaching movements with the left or right arm at a new workspace, under either the same dynamic condition (direct-effects) or a normal condition (after-effects). Results showed significant transfer within the same arm in terms of both direct- and after-effects, but significant transfer across the arms only in terms of direct-effects. These findings suggest that the formation of an internal model does not always result in after-effects. They also support the idea that the neural representation developed after sensorimotor adaptation comprise some aspects that are effector independent and other aspects that are effector dependent; and that direct- and after-effects following sensorimotor adaptation mainly reflect the effector-independent and the effector-dependent aspects, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Adapting hand movements to changes in our body or the environment is essential for skilled motor behavior. Although eye movements are known to assist hand movement control, how eye movements might contribute to the adaptation of hand movements remains largely unexplored. To determine to what extent eye movements contribute to visuomotor adaptation of hand tracking, participants were asked to track a visual target that followed an unpredictable trajectory with a cursor using a joystick. During blocks of trials, participants were either allowed to look wherever they liked or required to fixate a cross at the center of the screen. Eye movements were tracked to ensure gaze fixation as well as to examine free gaze behavior. The cursor initially responded normally to the joystick, but after several trials, the direction in which it responded was rotated by 90°. Although fixating the eyes had a detrimental influence on hand tracking performance, participants exhibited a rather similar time course of adaptation to rotated visual feedback in the gaze-fixed and gaze-free conditions. More importantly, there was extensive transfer of adaptation between the gazefixed and gaze-free conditions. We conclude that although eye movements are relevant for the online control of hand tracking, they do not play an important role in the visuomotor adaptation of such tracking. These results suggest that participants do not adapt by changing the mapping between eye and hand movements, but rather by changing the mapping between hand movements and the cursor’s motion independently of eye movements. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Eye movements assist hand movements in everyday activities, but their contribution to visuomotor adaptation remains largely unknown. We compared adaptation of hand tracking under free gaze and fixed gaze. Although our results confirm that following the target with the eyes increases the accuracy of hand movements, they unexpectedly demonstrate that gaze fixation does not hinder adaptation. These results suggest that eye movements have distinct contributions for online control and visuomotor adaptation of hand movements. © 2019 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Recent studies have demonstrated that task success signals can modulate learning during sensorimotor adaptation tasks, primarily through engaging explicit processes. Here, we examine the influence of task outcome on implicit adaptation, using a reaching task in which adaptation is induced by feedback that is not contingent on actual performance. We imposed an invariant perturbation (rotation) on the feedback cursor while varying the target size. In this way, the cursor either hit or missed the target, with the former producing a marked attenuation of implicit motor learning. We explored different computational architectures that might account for how task outcome information interacts with implicit adaptation. The results fail to support an architecture in which adaptation operates in parallel with a model-free operant reinforcement process. Rather, task outcome may serve as a gain on implicit adaptation or provide a distinct error signal for a second, independent implicit learning process. Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review. The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed (see decision letter). © Kim et al.},

abstract={Purpose: Previous work has found that both young and older adults exhibit a lexical bias in categorizing speech stimuli. In young adults, this has been argued to be an automatic influence of the lexicon on perceptual category boundaries. Older adults exhibit more top-down biases than younger adults, including an increased lexical bias. We investigated the nature of the increased lexical bias using a sensorimotor adaptation task designed to evaluate whether automatic processes drive this bias in older adults. Method: A group of older adults (n = 27) and younger adults (n = 35) participated in an altered auditory feedback production task. Participants produced target words and nonwords under altered feedback that affected the 1st formant of the vowel. There were 2 feedback conditions that affected the lexical status of the target, such that target words were shifted to sound more like nonwords (e.g., less-liss) and target nonwords to sound more like words (e.g., kess-kiss). Results: A mixed-effects linear regression was used to investigate the magnitude of compensation to altered auditory feedback between age groups and lexical conditions. Over the course of the experiment, older adults compensated (by shifting their production of 1st formant) more to altered auditory feedback when producing words that were shifted toward nonwords (less-liss) than when producing nonwords that were shifted toward words (kess-kiss). This is in contrast to younger adults who compensated more to nonwords that were shifted toward words compared to words that were shifted toward nonwords. Conclusion: We found no evidence that the increased lexical bias previously observed in older adults is driven by a greater sensitivity to top-down lexical influence on perceptual category boundaries. We suggest the increased lexical bias in older adults is driven by postperceptual processes that arise as a result of age-related cognitive and sensory changes. © 2019 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

abstract={Recent work suggests that the rate of learning in sensorimotor adaptation is likely not fixed, but rather can change based on previous experience. One example is savings, a commonly observed phenomenon whereby the relearning of a motor skill is faster than the initial learning. Sensorimotor adaptation is thought to be driven by sensory prediction errors, which are the result of a mismatch between predicted and actual sensory consequences. It has been proposed that during motor adaptation the generation of sensory prediction errors engages two processes (fast and slow) that differ in learning and retention rates. We tested the idea that a history of errors would influence both the fast and slow processes during savings. Participants were asked to perform the same force field adaptation task twice in succession. We found that adaptation to the force field a second time led to increases in estimated learning rates for both fast and slow processes. While it has been proposed that savings is explained by an increase in learning rate for the fast process, here we observed that the slow process also contributes to savings. Our work suggests that fast and slow adaptation processes are both responsive to a history of error and both contribute to savings. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We studied the underlying mechanisms of savings during motor adaptation. Using a two-state model to represent fast and slow processes that contribute to motor adaptation, we found that a history of error modulates performance in both processes. While previous research has attributed savings to only changes in the fast process, we demonstrated that an increase in both processes is needed to account for the measured behavioral data. © 2019 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Recent studies suggest that planned and corrective actions are recalibrated during some forms of motor adaptation. However, corrective (also known as reactive) movements in human locomotion are thought to simply reflect sudden environmental changes independently from sensorimotor recalibration. Thus, we asked whether corrective responses can indicate the motor system's adapted state following prolonged exposure to a novel walking situation inducing sensorimotor adaptation. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals bilaterally on 15 leg muscles before, during, and after split-belts walking (i.e., novel walking situation), in which the legs move at different speeds. We exploited the rapid temporal dynamics of corrective responses upon unexpected speed transitions to isolate them from the overall motor output. We found that corrective muscle activity was structurally different following short versus long exposures to split-belts walking. Only after a long exposure, removal of the novel environment elicited corrective muscle patterns that matched those expected in response to a perturbation opposite to the one originally experienced. This indicated that individuals who recalibrated their motor system adopted split-belts environment as their new "normal" and transitioning back to the original walking environment causes subjects to react as if it was novel to them. Interestingly, this learning declined with age, but steady state modulation of muscle activity during split-belts walking did not, suggesting potentially different neural mechanisms underlying these motor patterns. Taken together, our results show that corrective motor commands reflect the adapted state of the motor system, which is less flexible as we age. Copyright © 2019 Iturralde and Torres-Oviedo.},

abstract={Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of target medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation. © 2019 Luque et al.},

abstract={In daily life, we often need to make accurate and precise movements. However, our movements do not always end up as intended. When we are consistently too late to catch a ball for example, we need to update the predictions of the temporal consequences of our motor commands. These predictions can be improved when the brain evaluates sensory error signals. This is thought to be an optimal process, in which the relative reliabilities of the error signal and the prediction determine how much of an error is updated. Perturbation paradigms are used to identify how the brain learns from errors. Temporal perturbations (delays) between sensory signals impede the multisensory integration of these signals. Adaptation to these perturbations is often incomplete. We propose that the lack of adaptation is caused by an increased measurement noise that accompanies the temporal perturbation. We use a modification of the standard Kalman filter that allows for increases in measurement uncertainty with larger delays, and verify this model with a timing task on a screen. Participants were instructed to press a button when a ball reached a vertical line. Temporal feedback was given visually (unisensory consequence) or visually and auditory (multisensory consequence). The consequence of their button press was delayed incrementally with one ms per trial. Participants learned from their errors and started pressing the button earlier, but did not adapt fully. We found that our model, a Kalman filter with non-stationary measurement variance, could account for this pattern. Measurement variance increased less for the multisensory than the unisensory condition. In addition, we simulated our model's output for other perturbation paradigms and found that it could also account for fast de-adaptation. Our paper highlights the importance of evaluating changes in measurement noise when interpreting the results motor learning tasks that include perturbation paradigms. © 2019 Knelange and López-Moliner.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation is driven by mismatch errors between desired movements and actual movement outcomes. A mismatch error can be minimized by adjusting movements or by altering the interpretation of sensory information. While the effect of mismatch errors on the motor system has received much attention, the contribution of somatosensory feedback, particularly the sensory-motor interplay in the process of adaptation, remains poorly understood. Our study analyzes the impact of peripheral deefferentation on the plasticity of the brain networks responsible for sensory-motor adaptation, focusing particularly on changes in the processing of somatosensory information. For this aim, task-based and resting-state functional MRI was performed on 24 patients in the acute state of a left-sided idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy. The functional connectivity of cortical and subcortical networks was analyzed and compared to a healthy control group. We found a strong involvement of the somatosensory system and the thalamus in the adaptation process following an acute peripheral deefferentation. The investigated network shows the principal pattern of a reduced connectivity between cortical areas, while the connectivity to subcortical areas (the basal ganglia and the thalamus) is increased. We suggest that the increased connectivity between the subcortical and cortical structures indicates an active sensory-motor adaptation process. We further hypothesize that the decreased functional connectivity at the cortical level reflects an unsuccessful sensorimotor adaptation process due to the inability to solve the somatosensory-motor mismatch. These results extend our understanding of the somatosensory-motor interaction in response to a mismatch signal and highlight the importance of the thalamus in this process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={What we see is influenced by where we look. When confronted with multiple relevant targets, inaccurate saccade target selection can impair perceptual performance. Here we ask whether endpoint selection can be optimized by the mechanism maintaining saccade accuracy: saccade adaptation. Therefore, we introduce a double-target adaptation task, where a presaccadic peripheral stimulus (plaid) splits vertically into its two components (Gabor patches) during horizontal saccades. While both targets were task-relevant, one of them provided more information for the perceptual task, because it could only be identified after the saccade with near-foveal vision. The other target was highly salient and could also be identified in the presaccadic plaid using peripheral vision. This double-target paradigm induced saccade adaptation: Without a perceptual task, participants adapted to the salient target. When both targets were judged sequentially, participants mostly adapted to the target they had to judge first. When targets were judged simultaneously, endpoints were biased toward the informative target but showed no gradual learning and fell short of optimality. We observed gradual adaptation when targets shifted randomly such that a strategic adjustment of endpoints was not possible. Overall, these findings show that when multiple targets compete, our oculomotor system can learn to adjust endpoints in order to maximize information for perception. Yet individual variability and other factors affecting target priority play a crucial role. © 2019 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.},

abstract={Depth cue reweighting is a feedback-driven learning process that modifies the relative influences of different sources of three-dimensional shape information in perceptual judgments and or motor planning. In this study, we investigated the mechanism supporting reweighting of stereo and texture information by manipulating the haptic feedback obtained during a series of grasping movements. At the end of each grasp, the fingers closed down on a physical object that was consistent with one of the two cues, depending on the condition. Previous studies have shown that this style of visuomotor training leads to cue reweighting for perceptual judgments, but the time course has never been documented for a single training session, and many questions remain regarding the underlying mechanism, such as the pattern of feedback signals required to drive reweighting. We address these issues in two experiments, finding short-term changes in the motor response consistent with cue reweighting: the slope of the grip aperture with respect to the reliable cue increased, whereas the slope with respect to the unreliable cue decreased. Critically, Experiment 2 shows that slope changes do not occur when one of the cues is rendered with a constant bias; the grip aperture simply becomes uniformly larger or smaller. Our findings support a model of cue reweighting driven by altered correlations between haptic feedback and individual cues, rather than simple mismatches, which can be resolved by other mechanisms such as sensorimotor adaptation or cue recalibration. © 2019 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.},

abstract={Plasticity in the oculomotor system ensures that saccadic eye movements reliably meet their visual goals-to bring regions of interest into foveal, high-acuity vision. Here, we present a comprehensive description of sensorimotor learning in saccades. We induced continuous adaptation of saccade amplitudes using a double-step paradigm, in which participants saccade to a peripheral target stimulus, which then undergoes a surreptitious, intra-saccadic shift (ISS) as the eyes are in flight. In our experiments, the ISS followed a systematic variation, increasing or decreasing from one saccade to the next as a sinusoidal function of the trial number. Over a large range of frequencies, we confirm that adaptation gain shows (1) a periodic response, reflecting the frequency of the ISS with a delay of a number of trials, and (2) a simultaneous drift towards lower saccade gains. We then show that state-space-based linear time-invariant systems (LTIS) represent suitable generative models for this evolution of saccade gain over time. This state-equation algorithm computes the prediction of an internal (or hidden state-) variable by learning from recent feedback errors, and it can be compared to experimentally observed adaptation gain. The algorithm also includes a forgetting rate that quantifies per-trial leaks in the adaptation gain, as well as a systematic, non-error-based bias. Finally, we study how the parameters of the generative models depend on features of the ISS. Driven by a sinusoidal disturbance, the state-equation admits an exact analytical solution that expresses the parameters of the phenomenological description as functions of those of the generative model. Together with statistical model selection criteria, we use these correspondences to characterize and refine the structure of compatible state-equation models. We discuss the relation of these findings to established results and suggest that they may guide further design of experimental research across domains of sensorimotor adaptation. © 2019 Cassanello et al.

abstract={Context: Motor planning, a prerequisite for goal-driven movement, is a complex process that occurs in the cortex. Evidence has suggested that motor planning is altered in patients with chronic ankle instability (CAI). We know balance training can improve balance, but we do not know if it also improves motor planning. Such changes in cortical activity can be assessed using electroencephalography. Objective: To evaluate changes in cortical measures of motor planning after balance training in patients with CAI. Design: Controlled laboratory study. Setting: Research laboratory. Patients or Other Participants: Fifteen patients with CAI (age ¼ 20.80 6 2.37 years, height ¼ 169.47 6 7.95 cm, mass ¼ 70.45 6 19.25 kg). Intervention(s): A 4-week progression-based balance-training program. Main Outcome Measure(s): Motor planning was assessed via electroencephalography before a lateral-stepping task. We calculated event-related spectral perturbations in the h (4–8 Hz), a (8–12 Hz), b (14–25 Hz), and c (30–50 Hz) bands. The change in power (in decibels) was calculated in each band for the 500 milliseconds before the onset of the lateral-stepping movement. Additional outcomes were the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure
(FAAM)–Activities of Daily Living and Sport subscales; the anterior-, posteromedial-, and posterolateral-reach directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test; and static balance. Patients completed 3 test sessions: baseline, 24- to 48-hour posttest, and 1-week posttest. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to assess changes over time. The a level was set at .05. Results: The FAAM–Activities of Daily Living subscale score was improved at both posttests (P, .05), and the FAAM-Sport subscale score was improved at the 1-week posttest (P ¼ .008). Balance was better in all 3 directions of the Star Excursion Balance Test at both posttest sessions (P, .001). After balance training, no differences were identified in cortical activity at either posttest session (P . .05). Conclusions: No improvements were identified in electroencephalography measures of motor planning during lateral stepping in patients with CAI. Improved balance suggested that sensorimotor adaptations occurred, but they may not have transferred to the lateral-stepping task or they may have been mediated via other processes in patients with CAI. © by the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, Inc.},

abstract={Background. Passive robot-generated arm movements in conjunction with proprioceptive decision making and feedback modulate functional connectivity (FC) in sensory motor networks and improve sensorimotor adaptation in normal individuals. This proof-of-principle study investigates whether these effects can be observed in stroke patients. Methods. A total of 10 chronic stroke patients with a range of stable motor and sensory deficits (Fugl-Meyer Arm score [FMA] 0-65, Nottingham Sensory Assessment [NSA] 10-40) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after a single session of robot-controlled proprioceptive training with feedback. Changes in FC were identified in each patient using independent component analysis as well as a seed region–based approach. FC changes were related to impairment and changes in task performance were assessed. Results. A single training session improved average arm reaching accuracy in 6 and proprioception in 8 patients. Two networks showing training-associated FC change were identified. Network C1 was present in all patients and network C2 only in patients with FM scores >7. Relatively larger C1 volume in the ipsilesional hemisphere was associated with less impairment (r = 0.83 for NSA, r = 0.73 for FMA). This association was driven by specific regions in the contralesional hemisphere and their functional connections (supramarginal gyrus with FM scores r = 0.82, S1 with NSA scores r = 0.70, and cerebellum with NSA score r = −0.82). Conclusion. A single session of robot-controlled proprioceptive training with feedback improved movement accuracy and induced FC changes in sensory motor networks of chronic stroke patients. FC changes are related to functional impairment and comprise bilateral sensory and motor network nodes. © The Author(s) 2018.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation to wedge prisms can alter the balance of attention between left and right space in healthy adults, and improve symptoms of spatial neglect after stroke. Here we asked whether the orienting of spatial attention to visual stimuli is affected by a different form of sensorimotor adaptation that involves physical perturbations of arm movement, rather than distortion of visual feedback. Healthy participants performed a cued discrimination task before and after they made reaching movements to a central target. A velocity-dependent force field pushed the hand aside during each reach, and required participants to apply compensatory forces toward the opposite side. We used event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine whether electroencephalography (EEG) responses reflecting orienting (cue-locked N1) and disengagement (target-locked P1) of spatial attention are affected by adaptation to force fields. After adaptation, the cue-locked N1 was relatively larger for stimuli presented in the hemispace corresponding to the direction of compensatory hand force. P1 amplitudes evoked by invalidly cued targets presented on the opposite side were reduced. This suggests that force field adaptation boosted attentional orienting responses toward the side of hand forces, and impeded attentional disengagement from that side, mimicking previously reported effects of prism adaptation. Thus, remapping between motor commands and intended movement direction is sufficient to bias ERPs, reflecting changes in the orienting of spatial attention in the absence of visuo-spatial distortion or visuo-proprioceptive mismatch. Findings are relevant to theories of how sensorimotor adaptation can modulate attention, and may open new avenues for treatment of spatial neglect. © 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={While beta activity has been extensively studied in relation to voluntary movement, its role in sensorimotor adaptation remains largely uncertain. Recently, it has been shown that the post-movement beta rebound as well as beta activity during movement-preparation are modulated by movement errors. However, there are critical functional differences between pre- and post-movement beta activities. Here, we addressed two related open questions. Do the pre- and post-movement error-related modulations arise from distinct neural substrates? Do these modulations relate to efferent signals shaping muscle-activation patterns or do they reflect integration of sensory information, intervening upstream of the motor output? For this purpose, first we exploited independent component analysis (ICA) which revealed a double dissociation suggesting that distinct neural substrates are recruited in error-related beta-power modulations observed before and after movement. Second, we compared error-related beta oscillation responses observed in two bimanual reaching tasks involving similar movements but different interlimb coordination, and in which the same mechanical perturbations induced different behavioral adaptive responses. While the task difference was not reflected in the post-movement beta rebound, the pre-movement beta activity was differently modulated according to the interlimb coordination. Critically, we show an uncoupling between the behavioral and the electrophysiological responses during the movement preparation phase, which demonstrates that the error-related modulation of the foreperiod beta activity does not reflect changes in the motor output from primary motor cortex. It seems instead to relate to higher level processing of sensory afferents, essential for sensorimotor adaptation. © 2018},

abstract={Two auditory perturbation experiments were used to investigate the integrity of neural circuits responsible for speech sensorimotor adaptation in acquired apraxia of speech (AOS). This has implications for understanding the nature of AOS as well as normal speech motor control. Two experiments were conducted. In Experiment 1, compensatory responses to unpredictable fundamental frequency (F0) perturbations during vocalization were investigated in healthy older adults and adults with acquired AOS plus aphasia. F0 perturbation involved upward and downward 100-cent shifts versus no shift, in equal proportion, during 2 s vocalizations of the vowel /a/. In Experiment 2, adaptive responses to sustained first formant (F1) perturbations during speech were investigated in healthy older adults, adults with AOS and adults with aphasia only (APH). The F1 protocol involved production of the vowel /ε/ in four consonant-vowel words of Australian English (pear, bear, care, dare), and one control word with a different vowel (paw). An unperturbed Baseline phase was followed by a gradual Ramp to a 30% upward F1 shift stimulating a compensatory response, a Hold phase where the perturbation was repeatedly presented with alternating blocks of masking trials to probe adaptation, and an End phase with masking trials only to measure persistence of any adaptation. AOS participants showed normal compensation to unexpected F0 perturbations, indicating that auditory feedback control of low-level, non-segmental parameters is intact. Furthermore, individuals with AOS displayed an adaptive response to sustained F1 perturbations, but age-matched controls and APH participants did not. These findings suggest that older healthy adults may have less plastic motor programs that resist modification based on sensory feedback, whereas individuals with AOS have less well-established and more malleable motor programs due to damage from stroke. © 2018 Ballard, Halaki, Sowman, Kha, Daliri, Robin, Tourville and Guenther.},

abstract={The integration of sensorimotor information is important for accurate goal-directed movement and affects corticospinal excitability (CE). This study investigated CE during the motor preparation period in a goal-directed movement task with temporal feedback gaps. Each trial began with a pair of first-informative and second-response beeps presented successively as cues. Trials with temporal feedback gaps showed that virtual hand movements lagged 400 ms behind actual performed movements. The participants were instructed to prepare for movement in accordance with the first beep, start the movement upon hearing the second beep, and perform movements that were both fast and accurate to the virtual target. We delivered a single-pulse of transcranial magnetic stimulation to the first dorsal interosseous muscle 250 ms before the presentation of the response beep. Motor-evoked potential amplitudes with temporal feedback gaps were significantly higher than those without temporal feedback gaps. Moreover, motor-evoked potential amplitudes with temporal feedback gaps gradually decreased over the course of the trials, whereas those without temporal feedback gaps did not change. In summary, CE during the motor preparation period was increased by temporal feedback gaps, and this excitation decreased in accordance with adaptation to temporal feedback gaps.

abstract={Implicit sensorimotor adaptation is traditionally described as a process of error reduction, whereby a fraction of the error is corrected for with each movement. Here, in our study of healthy human participants, we characterize two constraints on this learning process: the size of adaptive corrections is only related to error size when errors are smaller than 6°, and learning functions converge to a similar level of asymptotic learning over a wide range of error sizes. These findings are problematic for current models of sensorimotor adaptation, and point to a new theoretical perspective in which learning is constrained by the size of the error correction, rather than sensitivity to error. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Perturbations of sensory feedback evoke sensory prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted and actual sensory outcomes of movements), and reward prediction errors (discrepancies between predicted rewards and actual rewards). When our task is to hit a target, we expect to succeed in hitting the target, and so we experience a reward prediction error if the perturbation causes us to miss it. These discrepancies between intended task outcomes and actual task outcomes, termed “task errors,” are thought to drive the use of strategic processes to restore success, although their role is incompletely understood. Here, as participants adapted to a 30° rotation of cursor feedback representing hand position, we investigated the role of task errors in sensorimotor adaptation: during target-reaching, we either removed task errors by moving the target mid-movement to align with cursor feedback of hand position, or enforced task error by moving the target away from the cursor feedback of hand position, by 20–30° randomly (clockwise in half the trials, counterclockwise in half the trials). Removing task errors not only reduced the extent of adaptation during exposure to the perturbation, but also reduced the amount of post-adaptation aftereffects that persisted despite explicit knowledge of the perturbation removal. Hence, task errors contribute to implicit adaptation resulting from sensory prediction errors. This suggests that the system which predicts the sensory consequences of actions via exposure to sensory prediction errors is also sensitive to reward prediction errors. © 2018 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={A previous study reported that movement directions adapt much better to 60° target displacements (double steps) when target displacements are introduced incrementally and not abruptly. The present study tested whether incremental adaptation to 60° discordances can be explained by specific cognitive abilities. The results showed that an increase of discordance size during adaptation enhanced reaction times. Furthermore, the individual performance in neuropsychological tests measuring sustained attention, figural fluency and perseveration predicted the rate of adaptation at different discordance sizes. These results are discussed with reference to recent models on directional selectivity and modularity during visually guided reaching. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={In the present study we evaluated changes in neural activation that occur over the time course of multiple days of sensorimotor adaptation, and identified individual neural predictors of adaptation and savings magnitude. We collected functional MRI data while participants performed a manual adaptation task during four separate test sessions over a three-month period. This allowed us to examine changes in activation and associations with adaptation and savings at subsequent sessions. Participants exhibited reliable savings of adaptation across the four sessions. Brain activity associated with early adaptation increased across the sessions in a variety of frontal, parietal, cingulate, and temporal cortical areas, as well as various subcortical areas. We found that savings was positively associated with activation in several striatal, parietal, and cingulate cortical areas including the putamen, precuneus, angular gyrus, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and cingulate motor area. These findings suggest that participants may learn how to better engage cognitive processes across days, potentially reflecting improvements in action selection. We propose that such improvements may rely on action-value assignments, which previously have been linked to the dACC and striatum. As correct movements are assigned a higher value than incorrect movements, the former are more likely to be performed again. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={For the healthy motor control system, an essential regulatory role is maintaining the equilibrium between keeping unwanted motor variability in check whilst allowing informative elements of motor variability. Kinematic studies in children with generalised dystonia (due to mixed aetiologies) show that movements are characterised by increased motor variability. In this study, the mechanisms by which high motor variability may influence movement generation in dystonia were investigated. Reaching movements in the symptomatic arm of 10 patients with DYT1 dystonia and 12 age-matched controls were captured using a robotic manipulandum and features of motor variability were extracted. Given that task-relevant variability and sensorimotor adaptation are related in health, markers of variability were then examined for any co-variance with performance indicators during an error-based learning visuomotor adaptation task. First, we confirmed that motor variability on a trial-by-trial basis was selectively increased in the homogenous and prototypical dystonic disorder DYT1 dystonia. Second, high baseline variability predicted poor performance in the subsequent visuomotor adaptation task offering insight into the rules which appear to govern dystonic motor control. The potential mechanisms behind increased motor variability and its corresponding implications for the rehabilitation of patients with DYT1 dystonia are highlighted. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={In the present EEG study, the role of auditory prediction in speech was explored through the comparison of auditory cortical responses during active speaking and passive listening to the same acoustic speech signals. Two manipulations of sensory prediction accuracy were used during the speaking task: (1) a real-time change in vowel F1 feedback (reducing prediction accuracy relative to unaltered feedback) and (2) presenting a stable auditory target rather than a visual cue to speak (enhancing auditory prediction accuracy during baseline productions, and potentially enhancing the perturbing effect of altered feedback). While subjects compensated for the F1 manipulation, no difference between the auditory-cue and visual-cue conditions were found. Under visually-cued conditions, reduced N1/P2 amplitude was observed during speaking vs. listening, reflecting a motor-to-sensory prediction. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of behavioral compensatory F1 response and the magnitude of this speaking induced suppression (SIS) for P2 during the altered auditory feedback phase, where a stronger compensatory decrease in F1 was associated with a stronger the SIS effect. Finally, under the auditory-cued condition, an auditory repetition-suppression effect was observed in N1/P2 amplitude during the listening task but not active speaking, suggesting that auditory predictive processes during speaking and passive listening are functionally distinct. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Speech and motor deficits are highly prevalent (>70%) in individuals with the 600 kb BP4-BP5 16p11.2 deletion; however, the mechanisms that drive these deficits are unclear, limiting our ability to target interventions and advance treatment. This study examined fundamental aspects of speech motor control in participants with the 16p11.2 deletion. To assess capacity for control of voice, we examined how accurately and quickly subjects changed the pitch of their voice within a trial to correct for a transient perturbation of the pitch of their auditory feedback. When compared to controls, 16p11.2 deletion carriers show an over-exaggerated pitch compensation response to unpredictable mid-vocalization pitch perturbations. We also examined sensorimotor adaptation of speech by assessing how subjects learned to adapt their sustained productions of formants (speech spectral peak frequencies important for vowel identity), in response to consistent changes in their auditory feedback during vowel production. Deletion carriers show reduced sensorimotor adaptation to sustained vowel identity changes in auditory feedback. These results together suggest that 16p11.2 deletion carriers have fundamental impairments in the basic mechanisms of speech motor control and these impairments may partially explain the deficits in speech and language in these individuals. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Though adaptive sensorimotor processes have been studied for simple, laboratory tasks such as reaching, less is known about how they might function during complex, real-world behaviors such as steering. The effects of altered vehicle dynamics on steering were investigated, using a physically moving electric vehicle outfitted with a portable virtual reality system. Vehicle dynamics were manipulated via changes in steering gain. Three groups of participants attempted to steer a series of curving paths with a lower steering gain, a higher steering gain, or a reversed steering gain. This adaptation phase was compared with pre-adaptation and post-adaptation phases, for which the steering gain was unaltered. As drivers accrued experience with the altered steering gains, they became more accurate and fluent in steering a vehicle. Adaptation to subtler steering gain changes was rapid, and without aftereffects, but adaptation to a more extreme steering gain (i.e., reversed) was slower, with aftereffects upon the initial return to the unaltered gain in the post-adaptation phase. Drivers can adapt relatively quickly to changes in steering gain, incorporating the relevant dynamics of the vehicle. The approach developed here could be used to refine theories of sensorimotor adaptation in the context of more practical applications, such as real-world human-tool systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Sensorimotor learning has been studied by altering the sound of the voice in real time as speech is produced. In response to voice alterations, learned changes in production reduce the perceived auditory error and persist for some time after the alteration is removed [1–5]. The results of such experiments have led to the development of prominent models of speech production. This work proposes that the control of speech relies on forward models to predict sensory outcomes of movements, and errors in these predictions drive sensorimotor learning [5–7]. However, sensorimotor learning in speech has only been observed following intensive training on a handful of discrete words or perceptually similar sentences. Stereotyped production does not capture the complex sensorimotor demands of fluid, real-world speech [8–11]. It remains unknown whether talkers predict the sensory consequences of variable sentence production to allow rapid and precise updating of speech motor plans when sensory prediction errors are encountered. Here, we used real-time alterations of speech feedback to test for sensorimotor learning during the production of 50 sentences that varied markedly in length, vocabulary, and grammar. Following baseline production, all vowels were simultaneously altered and played back through headphones in near real time. Robust feedforward changes in sentence production were observed that, on average, precisely countered the direction of the alteration. These changes occurred in every participant and transferred to the production of single words with varying vowel sounds. The results show that to maintain accurate sentence production, the brain actively predicts the auditory consequences of variable sentence-level speech. Sensorimotor learning is central to current models of speech motor control, yet it has only been observed following intensive training on discrete words or highly constrained sentences. Here, Lametti et al. demonstrate precise and transferable sensorimotor learning to real-time alterations of vowel sounds during the fluid production of varied sentences. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Distorted visual feedback (DVF) during locomotion has been suggested to result in the development of a new walking pattern in healthy individuals through implicit learning processes. Recent work in upper extremity visuomotor rotation paradigms suggest that these paradigms involve implicit and explicit learning. Additionally, in upper extremity visuomotor paradigms, the verbal cues provided appear to impact how a behavior is learned and when this learned behavior is used. Here, in two experiments in neurologically intact individuals, we tested how verbal instruction impacts learning a new locomotor pattern on a treadmill through DVF, the transfer of that pattern to overground walking, and what types of learning occur (i.e., implicit vs. explicit learning). In experiment 1, we found that the instructions provided impacted the amount learned through DVF, but not the size of the aftereffects or the amount of the pattern transferred to overground walking. Additionally, the aftereffects observed were significantly different from the baseline walking pattern, but smaller than the behavior changes observed during learning, which is uncharacteristic of implicit sensorimotor adaptation. Thus, experiment 2 aimed to determine the cause of these discrepancies. In this experiment, when VF was not provided, individuals continued using the learned walking pattern when instructed to do so and returned toward their baseline pattern when instructed to do so. Based on these results, we conclude that DVF during locomotion results in a large portion of explicit learning and a small portion of implicit learning. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The results of this study suggest that distorted visual feedback during locomotor learning involves the development of an explicit strategy with only a small component of implicit learning. This is important because previous studies using distorted visual feedback have suggested that locomotor learning relies primarily on implicit learning. This paradigm, therefore, provides a new way to examine a different form of learning in locomotion. © 2018 American Physiological Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={How movements are continuously adapted to physiological and environmental changes is a fundamental question in systems neuroscience. While many studies have elucidated the mechanisms which underlie short-term sensorimotor adaptation (∼10–30 min), how these motor memories are maintained over longer-term (>3–5 days) -and thanks to which neural systems-is virtually unknown. Here, we examine in healthy human participants whether the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) is causally involved in the induction and/or the retention of saccadic eye movements’ adaptation. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) was applied while subjects performed a ∼15min size-decrease adaptation task of leftward reactive saccades. A TMS pulse was delivered over the TPJ in the right hemisphere (rTPJ) in each trial either 30, 60, 90 or 120 msec (in 4 separate adaptation sessions) after the saccade onset. In two control groups of subjects, the same adaptation procedure was achieved either alone (No-TMS) or combined with spTMS applied over the vertex (SHAM-TMS). While the timing of spTMS over the rTPJ did not significantly affect the speed and immediate after-effect of adaptation, we found that the amount of adaptation retention measured 10 days later was markedly larger (42%) than in both the No-TMS (21%) and the SHAM-TMS (11%) control groups. These results demonstrate for the first time that the cerebral cortex is causally involved in maintaining long-term oculomotor memories. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Using an individual differences approach, we evaluated whether manual and locomotor adaptation are associated in terms of adaptation and savings across days, and whether they rely on shared underlying mechanisms involving visuospatial working memory or visual field dependence. Participants performed a manual and a locomotor adaptation task during 4 separate test sessions over a 3-month period. Reliable adaptation and savings were observed for both tasks. It was further found that higher visuospatial working memory performance and lower visual field dependence scores were associated with faster learning in the manual and locomotor tasks, respectively. Moreover, adaptation rates were correlated between the 2 tasks in the final test session, suggesting that people may gradually be learning something generalizable about the adaptation process. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Although age-related declines in cognitive, sensory and motor capacities are well documented, current evidence is mixed as to whether or not aging impairs sensorimotor adaptation to a novel dynamic environment. More importantly, the extent to which any deficits in sensorimotor adaptation are due to general impairments in neural plasticity, or impairments in the specific processes that drive adaptation is unclear. Here we investigated whether there are age-related differences in electrophysiological responses to reaching endpoint and trajectory errors caused by a novel force field, and whether markers of error processing relate to the ability of older adults to adapt their movements. Older and young adults (N = 24/group, both sexes) performed 600 reaches to visual targets, and received audio-visual feedback about task success or failure after each trial. A velocity-dependent curl field pushed the hand to one side during each reach. We extracted ERPs time-locked to movement onset [kinematic error-related negativity (kERN)], and the presentation of success/failure feedback [feedback error-related negativity (fERN)]. At a group level, older adults did not differ from young adults in the rate or extent of sensorimotor adaptation, but EEG responses to both trajectory errors and task errors were reduced in the older group. Most interestingly, the amplitude of the kERN correlated with the rate and extent of sensorimotor adaptation in older adults. Thus, older adults with an impaired capacity for encoding kinematic trajectory errors also have compromised abilities to adapt their movements in a novel dynamic environment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Divergence is known to differ from convergence across a wide range of clinical parameters. We have postulated that a limited neural substrate results in reduced fusional divergence velocities and subsequently a reduced capacity to adapt tonic vergence to uncrossed disparities. We further investigated this hypothesis by characterizing the degree of plasticity in reflexive fusional vergence to repetitive end-point errors using a disparity-based double-step paradigm. 10 adults completed 4 study visits where reflexive fusional convergence or divergence was measured (250 Hz infrared oculography) to a 2° disparity step and then lengthened or shortened via a repeated double-step (2° ± 1.5°). Stimuli were presented dichoptically at 40 cm. Adaptive modification of vergence responses was similar between directions for the shortening conditions, suggesting a common neural mechanism responds to overshooting errors. In comparison, adaptive lengthening of convergence was slower, but of equal magnitude, suggesting a second neural mechanism with a longer time constant for undershooting errors. Divergence response velocities were slower at baseline and did not increase after adaptive lengthening. Instead, increases in divergence response amplitudes were a result of increased response duration, implying saturation of the reflexive, preprogrammed response. Adaptive responses serving to increase or decrease reflexive fusional vergence recruitment were asymmetric. Adaptive lengthening of convergence and divergence identified further directional asymmetries. The results support the hypothesis that the neural substrate underlying divergence is attenuated, resulting in reduced reflexive plasticity when compared to convergence. The clinical and technological implications of these results are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Previous research suggests that the ability to adapt motor behaviour to sudden environmental changes may be impaired in older adults. Here, we investigated whether the adaptation of grasping behaviour in response to a visual–haptic size conflict is also affected by increasing age. 30 older and 18 young adults were instructed to grasp a hidden block whilst viewing a second block in a congruent position. Initially block sizes were equal, but after a set number of trials a sensory conflict was introduced by covertly changing the hidden block for a smaller or larger block. The scale and speed of maximum grasp aperture adaptation to the increase or decrease in the size of the hidden block was measured. Older adults successfully adapted to the visual–haptic size conflict in a similar manner to young adults, despite a tendency to adapt less when the hidden block increased in size. This finding is attributed to the physical capabilities of the grasping hand of older adults, rather than an effect of age-related sensory or cognitive decline. The speed of grasp adaptation did not differ between age groups; however, awareness of the visual–haptic conflict lead to faster adaptation. These findings suggest that sensorimotor adaptation for grasping is intact for cognitively healthy older adults. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={We investigated Mandarin speakers’ control of lexical tone production with F0-perturbed auditory feedback. Subjects produced high level (T1), mid rising (T2), low dipping (T3), and high falling (T4) tones in conditions with (a) no perturbation, (b) T1 shifted down, (c) T1 shifted down and T3 shifted up, or (d) T1 shifted down and T3 shifted up but without producing other tones. Speakers and new subjects also completed a tone identification task with unaltered and F0-perturbed productions. With only T1 perturbed down, speakers adapted by raising F0 relative to no-perturbation. With simultaneous T1 down and T3 up perturbations, no T1 adaptation occurred, and T3 adaptation occurred only if T2 was also produced. Identification accuracy with stimuli representing adapted productions was comparable to baseline, but with simulated non-adapted productions it was reduced for T2 and T3. Thus, Mandarin speakers’ adaptation to F0 perturbations is linguistically constrained and serves to maintain tone contrast. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The present study used event-related potential (ERP) recordings to investigate the neural mechanisms of sensorimotor adaptation in response to altered auditory feedback (AAF) during vocal production. 12 healthy speakers were tested under a vocal motor adaptation paradigm in which the fundamental frequency (F0) of their voice auditory feedback was pitch-shifted downward by one semi-tone (− 100 cents) during vowel vocalizations. Behavioral results revealed that subjects adapted to AAF by producing opposing (upward) responses to pitch-shift stimuli, and this adaptive behavior persisted after feedback alteration was removed (washout). We found that adaptation to AAF was accompanied by a significant increase in the amplitude of a parietal ERP activity elicited after the onset of vocalization. However, no such effect was observed for pre-motor ERPs elicited before vocalization onset. Moreover, we found that adaptive vocal responses were negatively correlated with ERPs over the parietal and positively correlated with those over the fronto-central areas after vocalization onset. These findings suggest that vocal motor adaptation is mediated by sensorimotor reprogramming of feedforward motor commands through incorporating auditory feedback, which is indexed by modulation of behavioral and ERP responses to AAF. We suggest that modulation of neural activities in the parietal cortex highlights its significance as a neural interface for sensorimotor integration and indicates its critical role in vocal motor adaptation. Our findings support the notion that the parietal mechanisms are involved in driving adaptive motor behavior to cope with unexpected changes in the sensory environment to accomplish communication goals during vocal production and motor control. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Despite being overlooked in theoretical models of stress-related disorders, differences in cerebellar structure and function are consistently reported in studies of individuals exposed to current and early-life stressors. However, the mediating processes through which stress impacts upon cerebellar function are currently unknown. The aim of the current experiment was to test the effects of experimentally-induced acute stress on cerebellar functioning, using a classic, forward saccadic adaptation paradigm in healthy, young men and women. Stress induction was achieved by employing the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST), a task employing mental arithmetic and negative social feedback to generate significant physiological and endocrine stress responses. Saccadic adaptation was elicited using the double-step target paradigm. In the experiment, 48 participants matched for gender and age were exposed to either a stress (n = 25) or a control (n = 23) condition. Saliva for cortisol analysis was collected before, immediately after, and 10, and 30 min after the MIST. Saccadic adaptation was assessed approximately 10 min after stress induction, when cortisol levels peaked. Participants in the stress group reported significantly more stress symptoms and exhibited greater total cortisol output compared to controls. The stress manipulation was associated with slower learning rates in the stress group, while control participants acquired adaptation faster. Learning rates were negatively associated with cortisol output and mood disturbance. Results suggest that experimentally-induced stress slowed acquisition of cerebellar-dependent saccadic adaptation, related to increases in cortisol output. These ‘proof-of-principle’ data demonstrate that stress modulates cerebellar-related functions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Key points: Previous work demonstrated an effect of a single high-intensity exercise bout coupled with motor practice on the retention of a newly acquired skilled arm movement, in both neurologically intact and impaired adults. In the present study, using behavioural and computational analyses we demonstrated that a single exercise bout, regardless of its intensity and timing, did not increase the retention of a novel locomotor task after stroke. Considering both present and previous work, we postulate that the benefits of exercise effect may depend on the type of motor learning (e.g. skill learning, sensorimotor adaptation) and/or task (e.g. arm accuracy-tracking task, walking). Abstract: Acute high-intensity exercise coupled with motor practice improves the retention of motor learning in neurologically intact adults. However, whether exercise could improve the retention of locomotor learning after stroke is still unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of exercise intensity and timing on the retention of a novel locomotor learning task (i.e. split-belt treadmill walking) after stroke. Thirty-seven people post stroke participated in two sessions, 24 h apart, and were allocated to active control (CON), treadmill walking (TMW), or total body exercise on a cycle ergometer (TBE). In session 1, all groups exercised for a short bout (∼5 min) at low (CON) or high (TMW and TBE) intensity and before (CON and TMW) or after (TBE) the locomotor learning task. In both sessions, the locomotor learning task was to walk on a split-belt treadmill in a 2:1 speed ratio (100% and 50% fast-comfortable walking speed) for 15 min. To test the effect of exercise on 24 h retention, we applied behavioural and computational analyses. Behavioural data showed that neither high-intensity group showed greater 24 h retention compared to CON, and computational data showed that 24 h retention was attributable to a slow learning process for sensorimotor adaptation. Our findings demonstrated that acute exercise coupled with a locomotor adaptation task, regardless of its intensity and timing, does not improve retention of the novel locomotor task after stroke. We postulate that exercise effects on motor learning may be context specific (e.g. type of motor learning and/or task) and interact with the presence of genetic variant (BDNF Val66Met). © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Experience of a prediction error recruits multiple motor learning processes, some that learn strongly from error but have weak retention and some that learn weakly from error but exhibit strong retention. These processes are not generally observable but are inferred from their collective influence on behavior. Is there a robust way to uncover the hidden processes? A standard approach is to consider a state space model where the hidden states change following experience of error and then fit the model to the measured data by minimizing the squared error between measurement and model prediction. We found that this least-squares algorithm (LMSE) often yielded unrealistic predictions about the hidden states, possibly because of its neglect of the stochastic nature of error-based learning. We found that behavioral data during adaptation was better explained by a system in which both error-based learning and movement production were stochastic processes. To uncover the hidden states of learning, we developed a generalized expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. In simulation, we found that although LMSE tracked the measured data marginally better than EM, EM was far more accurate in unmasking the time courses and properties of the hidden states of learning. In a power analysis designed to measure the effect of an intervention on sensorimotor learning, EM significantly reduced the number of subjects that were required for effective hypothesis testing. In summary, we developed a new approach for analysis of data in sensorimotor experiments. The new algorithm improved the ability to uncover the multiple processes that contribute to learning from error. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor learning is supported by multiple adaptive processes, each with distinct error sensitivity and forgetting rates. We developed a generalized expectation maximization algorithm that uncovers these hidden processes in the context of modern sensorimotor learning experiments that include error-clamp trials and set breaks. The resulting toolbox may improve the ability to identify the properties of these hidden processes and reduce the number of subjects needed to test the effectiveness of interventions on sensorimotor learning. © 2018 the American Physiological Society.

abstract={In this study, we investigate whether individual variability in the rate of visuomotor adaptation and multiday savings is associated with differences in regional gray matter volume and resting-state functional connectivity. Thirty-four participants performed a manual adaptation task during two separate test sessions, on average 9 days apart. Functional connectivity strength between sensorimotor, dorsal cingulate, and temporoparietal regions of the brain was found to predict the rate of learning during the early phase of the adaptation task. In contrast, default mode network connectivity strength was found to predict both the rate of learning during the late adaptation phase and savings. As for structural predictors, greater gray matter volume in temporoparietal and occipital regions predicted faster early learning, whereas greater gray matter volume in superior posterior regions of the cerebellum predicted faster late learning. These findings suggest that the offline neural predictors of early adaptation may facilitate the cognitive aspects of sensorimotor adaptation, supported by the involvement of temporoparietal and cingulate networks.

abstract={Previous studies have shown that adults who stutter produce smaller corrective motor responses to compensate for unexpected auditory perturbations in comparison to adults who do not stutter, suggesting that stuttering may be associated with deficits in integration of auditory feedback for online speech monitoring. In this study, we examined whether stuttering is also associated with deficiencies in integrating and using discrepancies between expected and received auditory feedback to adaptively update motor programs for accurate speech production. Using a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm, we measured adaptive speech responses to auditory formant frequency perturbations in adults and children who stutter and their matched nonstuttering controls. We found that the magnitude of the speech adaptive response for children who stutter did not differ from that of fluent children. However, the adaptation magnitude of adults who stutter in response to auditory perturbation was significantly smaller than the adaptation magnitude of adults who do not stutter. Together these results indicate that stuttering is associated with deficits in integrating discrepancies between predicted and received auditory feedback to calibrate the speech production system in adults but not children. This auditory-motor integration deficit thus appears to be a compensatory effect that develops over years of stuttering. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={To accomplish effective motor control, the brain contains an internal forward model that predicts the expected sensory consequence of a motor command. When this prediction is inaccurate, a sensory prediction error is produced which adapts the forward model to make more accurate predictions of future movements. Other types of errors, such as task performance errors or reward, play less of a role in adapting a forward model. This raises the following question: What unique information is conveyed by the sensory prediction error that results in forward model adaptation? sensory prediction errors typically contain both the magnitude and direction of the error, but it is unclear if both components are necessary for adaptation or a single component is sufficient. In this article, we address this by having participants learn to counter a visuomotor rotation, which induces an angular mismatch between movements of the hand and visual feedback. We manipulated the information content of the visual feedback, in the form of a line, which accurately represented only the magnitude (distance), direction, or both magnitude and direction, of the virtual cursor relative to the target. We demonstrate that sensorimotor adaptation does not occur, or is minimal, when feedback is limited to information about the magnitude of an error. In contrast, sensorimotor adaptation is present when feedback is limited only to the direction of an error or when it contains combined direction and magnitude information. This result stands in contrast to current computational models of cerebellar-based sensorimotor adaptation that use error magnitude to drive adaptation. © 2017 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Auditory modulation during speech movement planning is limited in adults who stutter (AWS), but the functional relevance of the phenomenon itself remains unknown. We investigated for AWS and adults who do not stutter (AWNS) (a) a potential relationship between pre-speech auditory modulation and auditory feedback contributions to speech motor learning and (b) the effect on pre-speech auditory modulation of real-time versus delayed auditory feedback. Experiment I used a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm to estimate auditory-motor speech learning. Using acoustic speech recordings, we quantified subjects' formant frequency adjustments across trials when continually exposed to formant-shifted auditory feedback. In Experiment II, we used electroencephalography to determine the same subjects' extent of pre-speech auditory modulation (reductions in auditory evoked potential N1 amplitude) when probe tones were delivered prior to speaking versus not speaking. To manipulate subjects' ability to monitor real-time feedback, we included speaking conditions with non-altered auditory feedback (NAF) and delayed auditory feedback (DAF). Experiment I showed that auditory-motor learning was limited for AWS versus AWNS, and the extent of learning was negatively correlated with stuttering frequency. Experiment II yielded several key findings: (a) our prior finding of limited pre-speech auditory modulation in AWS was replicated; (b) DAF caused a decrease in auditory modulation for most AWNS but an increase for most AWS; and (c) for AWS, the amount of auditory modulation when speaking with DAF was positively correlated with stuttering frequency. Lastly, AWNS showed no correlation between pre-speech auditory modulation (Experiment II) and extent of auditory-motor learning (Experiment I) whereas AWS showed a negative correlation between these measures. Thus, findings suggest that AWS show deficits in both pre-speech auditory modulation and auditory-motor learning; however, limited pre-speech modulation is not directly related to limited auditory-motor adaptation; and in AWS, DAF paradoxically tends to normalize their otherwise limited pre-speech auditory modulation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Objective. To compensate for a limb lost in an amputation, myoelectric prostheses use surface electromyography (EMG) from the remaining muscles to control the prosthesis. Despite considerable progress, myoelectric controls remain markedly different from the way we normally control movements, and require intense user adaptation. To overcome this, our goal is to explore concurrent machine co-adaptation techniques that are developed in the field of brain-machine interface, and that are beginning to be used in myoelectric controls. Approach. We combined a simplified myoelectric control with a perturbation for which human adaptation is well characterized and modeled, in order to explore co-adaptation settings in a principled manner. Results. First, we reproduced results obtained in a classical visuomotor rotation paradigm in our simplified myoelectric context, where we rotate the muscle pulling vectors used to reconstruct wrist force from EMG. Then, a model of human adaptation in response to directional error was used to simulate various co-adaptation settings, where perturbations and machine co-adaptation are both applied on muscle pulling vectors. These simulations established that a relatively low gain of machine co-adaptation that minimizes final errors generates slow and incomplete adaptation, while higher gains increase adaptation rate but also errors by amplifying noise. After experimental verification on real subjects, we tested a variable gain that cumulates the advantages of both, and implemented it with directionally tuned neurons similar to those used to model human adaptation. This enables machine co-adaptation to locally improve myoelectric control, and to absorb more challenging perturbations. Significance. The simplified context used here enabled to explore co-adaptation settings in both simulations and experiments, and to raise important considerations such as the need for a variable gain encoded locally.

abstract={Objective This study examined adaptive responses to auditory perturbation of fundamental frequency (fo) in speakers with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and control speakers. Method Sixteen speakers with PD and nineteen control speakers produced sustained vowels while they received perturbed auditory feedback (i.e., fo shifted upward or downward). Speakers’ pitch acuity was quantified using a just-noticeable-difference (JND) paradigm. Twelve listeners provided estimates of the speech intelligibility for speakers with PD. Results Fifteen responses from each speaker group for each shift direction were included in analyses. While control speakers generally showed consistent adaptive responses opposing the perturbation, speakers with PD showed no compensation on average, with individual PD speakers showing highly variable responses. In the PD group, the degree of compensation was not significantly correlated with age, disease progression, pitch acuity, or intelligibility. Conclusions These findings indicate reduced adaptation to sustained fo perturbation and higher variability in PD compared to control participants. No significant differences were seen in pitch acuity between groups, suggesting that the fo adaptation deficit in PD is not the result of purely perceptual mechanisms. Significance These results suggest there is an impairment in vocal motor control in PD. Building on these results, contributions can be made to developing targeted voice treatments for PD. © 2018 Abur et al.

abstract={Recent studies have suggested that individuals can form multiple motor memories when simultaneously adapting to multiple, but oppositely-oriented perturbations. These findings predict that individuals detect the change in learning context, allowing the selective initialization and update of motor memories. However, previous electrophysiological studies of sensorimotor adaptation have not identified a neural mechanism supporting the detection of a context switch and adaptation to separate contexts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that such a mechanism is identifiable through neural oscillations measured through EEG. Human participants learned to manipulate an object in two opposite contexts (mass distribution). This task was designed based on previous work showing that people can adapt to both contexts. We found that sensorimotor α and β, and medial frontal θ frequency bands all exhibited different response patterns with respect to the error in each context. To determine whether any frequency's responses to error were distinctly related to a switch in context, we predicted single-trial EEG data from a computational learning model that can adapt to multiple contexts simultaneously based on a switching mechanism. This analysis revealed that only medial frontal θ was predicted by a component of the model state that adapts to errors based on a context switch. In contrast, α and β were predicted by a model state that was updated from performance errors independent of the context. These findings provide novel evidence showing that sensorimotor and medial frontal oscillations are predicted by different adaptation processes, and that changes in medial frontal activity may indicate the formation of motor memories by responding to changes in learning context. © 2017},

abstract={Early detection of the behavioural deficits of neurodegenerative diseases may help to describe the pathogenesis of such diseases and establish important biomarkers of disease progression. The aim of this study was to identify how sensorimotor adaptation of the upper limb, a cerebellar-dependent process restoring movement accuracy after introduction of a perturbation, is affected at the pre-clinical and clinical stages of spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6), an inherited neurodegenerative disease. We demonstrate that initial adaptation to the perturbation was significantly impaired in the eighteen individuals with clinical motor symptoms but mostly preserved in the five pre-clinical individuals. Moreover, the amount of error reduction correlated with the clinical symptoms, with the most symptomatic patients adapting the least. Finally both pre-clinical and clinical individuals showed significantly reduced de-Adaptation performance after the perturbation was removed in comparison to the control participants. Thus, in this large study of motor features in SCA6, we provide novel evidence for the existence of subclinical motor dysfunction at a pre-clinical stage of SCA6. Our findings show that testing sensorimotor de-Adaptation could provide a potential predictor of future motor deficits in SCA6. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Sensorimotor control requires an accurate estimate of the state of the body. The brain optimizes state estimation by combining sensory signals with predictions of the sensory consequences of motor commands using a forward model. Given that both sensory signals and predictions are uncertain (i.e., noisy), the brain optimally weights the relative reliance on each source of information during adaptation. In support, it is known that uncertainty in the sensory predictions influences the rate and generalization of visuomotor adaptation. We investigated whether uncertainty in the sensory predictions affects the retention of a new visuomotor relationship. This was done by exposing three separate groups to a visuomotor rotation whose mean was common at 15° counterclockwise but whose variance around the mean differed (i.e., SD of 0°, 3.2°, or 4.5°). Retention was assessed by measuring the persistence of the adapted behavior in a no-vision phase. Results revealed that mean reach direction late in adaptation was similar across groups, suggesting it depended mainly on the mean of exposed rotations and was robust to differences in variance. However, retention differed across groups, with higher levels of variance being associated with a more rapid reversion toward nonadapted behavior. A control experiment ruled out the possibility that differences in retention were accounted for by differences in success rates. Exposure to variable rotations may have increased the uncertainty in sensory predictions, making the adapted forward model more labile and susceptible to change or decay. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The brain predicts the sensory consequences of motor commands through a forward model. These predictions are subject to uncertainty. We use visuomotor adaptation and modulate uncertainty in the sensory predictions by manipulating the variance in exposed rotations. Results reveal that variance does not influence the final extent of adaptation but selectively impairs the retention of motor memories. These results suggest that a more uncertain forward model is more susceptible to change or decay. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Learned compensations for perturbed visual feedback of movement extent and direction generalize differently to unpracticed movement directions, which suggests different underlying neural mechanisms. Here we investigated whether gain and rotation adaptations are consistent with representation in different coordinate systems. Subjects performed a force-aiming task with the wrist and learned different gains or rotations for different force directions. Generalization was tested without visual feedback for the same extrinsic directions but with the forearm in a different pronationsupination orientation. When the change in forearm orientation caused the adapted visuomotor map to conflict in extrinsic and joint-based coordinates, rotation generalization occurred in extrinsic coordinates but with reduced magnitude. In contrast, gain generalization appeared reduced and phase shifted. When the forearm was rotated further, such that all imposed perturbations aligned in both joint-based and extrinsic coordinates in both postures, rotation generalization was further reduced, whereas there was neither reduction nor phase shift in the pattern of extent generalization. These results show that rotation generalization was expressed in extrinsic coordinates, and that generalization magnitude was modulated by posture. In contrast, gain generalization appeared to depend on target direction defined by an integrated combination of extrinsic and joint-based coordinates and was not reduced substantially by posture changes alone. Although the quality of the model fit underlying our interpretation prevents us from making strong conclusions, the data suggest that adaptations of movement direction and extent are represented according to distinct coordinate systems. New and Noteworthy Visuomotor gain and rotation adaptations generalize differently to novel movement directions, which suggests different neural mechanisms. When extrinsic and joint-based coordinates are effectively dissociated in an isometric aiming task, we find that they also generalize in different coordinate systems. Specifically, rotation generalized in extrinsic coordinates and decayed as posture departed from that adopted during adaptation. In contrast, gain generalization was expressed according to mixed extrinsic/joint-based coordinates and was not substantially reduced by postural changes. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Understanding the impact of weightlessness on human behavior during the forthcoming long-term space missions is of critical importance, especially when considering the efficiency of goal-directed movements in these unusual environments. Several studies provided a large set of evidence that gravity is taken into account during the planning stage of arm reaching movements to optimally anticipate its consequence upon the moving limbs. However, less is known about sensorimotor changes required to face weightless environments when individuals have to perform fast and accurate goal-directed actions with whole-body displacement. We thus aimed at characterizing kinematic features of whole-body reaching movements in microgravity, involving high spatiotemporal constraints of execution, to question whether and how humans are able to maintain the performance of a functional behavior in the standards of normogravity execution. Seven participants were asked to reach as fast and as accurately as possible visual targets while standing during microgravity episodes in parabolic flight. Small and large targets were presented either close or far from the participants (requiring, in the latter case, additional whole-body displacement). Results reported that participants successfully performed the reaching task with general temporal features of movement (e.g., movement speed) close to land observations. However, our analyses also demonstrated substantial kinematic changes related to the temporal structure of focal movement and the postural strategy to successfully perform -constrained- whole-body reaching movements in microgravity. These immediate reorganizations are likely achieved by rapidly taking into account the absence of gravity in motor preparation and execution (presumably from cues about body limbs unweighting). Specifically, when compared to normogravity, the arm deceleration phase substantially increased. Furthermore, greater whole-body forward displacements due to smaller trunk flexions occurred when reaching far targets in microgravity. Remarkably, these changes of focal kinematics and postural strategy appear close to those previously reported when participants performed the same task underwater with neutral buoyancy applied to body limbs. Overall, these novel findings reveal that humans are able to maintain the performance of functional goal-directed whole-body actions in weightlessness by successfully managing spatiotemporal constraints of execution in this unusual environment. © 2017 Macaluso, Bourdin, Buloup, Mille, Sainton, Sarlegna, Vercher and Bringoux.},

abstract={Previous work documented that sensorimotor adaptation transfers between sensory modalities: When subjects adapt with one arm to a visuomotor distortion while responding to visual targets, they also appear to be adapted when they are subsequently tested with auditory targets. Vice versa, when they adapt to an auditory-motor distortion while pointing to auditory targets, they appear to be adapted when they are subsequently tested with visual targets. Therefore, it was concluded that visuomotor as well as auditory-motor adaptation use the same adaptation mechanism. Furthermore, it has been proposed that sensory information from the trained modality is weighted larger than sensory information from an untrained one, because transfer between sensory modalities is incomplete. The present study tested these hypotheses for dual arm adaptation. One arm adapted to an auditory-motor distortion and the other either to an opposite directed auditory-motor or visuomotor distortion. We found that both arms adapted significantly. However, compared to reference data on single arm adaptation, adaptation in the dominant arm was reduced indicating interference from the non-dominant to the dominant arm. We further found that arm-specific aftereffects of adaptation, which reflect recalibration of sensorimotor transformation rules, were stronger or equally strong when targets were presented in the previously adapted compared to the non-adapted sensory modality, even when one arm adapted visually and the other auditorily. The findings are discussed with respect to a recently published schematic model on sensorimotor adaptation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In daily life, people are constantly presented with situations in which they have to learn and acquire new motor skills in complex environments, where attention is often distracted by other events. Being able to generalize and perform the acquired motor action in different environments is a crucial part of visuomotor learning. The current study examined whether attentional distraction impairs generalization of visuomotor adaptation or whether consistent distraction can operate as an internal cue to facilitate generalization. Using a dual-task paradigm combining visuomotor rotational adaptation and an attention- demanding secondary task, we showed that switching the attentional context from training (dual-task) to generalization (single-task) reduced the range of transfer of visuomotor adaptation to untrained directions. However, when consistent distraction was present throughout training and generalization, visuomotor generalization was equivalent to without distractions at all. Furthermore, this attentional context-dependent generalization was evident even when sensory modality of distractions differed between training and generalization. Therefore, the general nature of the dual tasks, rather than the specific stimuli, is associated with visuomotor memory and serves as a critical cue for generalization. Taken together, we demonstrated that attention plays a critical role during sensorimotor adaptation in selecting and associating multisensory signals with motor memory. This finding provides insight into developing learning programs that are generalizable in complex daily environments. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Learning novel motor actions in complex environments with attentional distraction is a critical function. Successful motor learning involves the ability to transfer the acquired skill from the trained to novel environments. Here, we demonstrate attentional distraction does not impair visuomotor adaptation. Rather, consistency in the attentional context from training to generalization modulates the degree of transfer to untrained locations. The role of attention and memory must, therefore, be incorporated into existing models of visuomotor learning. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Individuals with damage to the cerebellum perform poorly in sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. This deficit has been attributed to impairment in sensory prediction error-based updating of an internal forward model, a form of implicit learning. These individuals can, however, successfully counter a perturbation when instructed with an explicit aiming strategy. This successful use of an instructed aiming strategy presents a paradox: In adaptation tasks, why do individuals with cerebellar damage not come up with an aiming solution on their own to compensate for their implicit learning deficit? To explore this question, we employed a variant of a visuomotor rotation task in which, before executing a movement on each trial, the participants verbally reported their intended aiming location. Compared with healthy control participants, participants with spinocerebellar ataxia displayed impairments in both implicit learning and aiming. This was observed when the visuomotor rotation was introduced abruptly (experiment 1) or gradually (experiment 2). This dual deficit does not appear to be related to the increased movement variance associated with ataxia: Healthy undergraduates showed little change in implicit learning or aiming when their movement feedback was artificially manipulated to produce similar levels of variability (experiment 3). Taken together the results indicate that a consequence of cerebellar dysfunction is not only impaired sensory prediction error-based learning but also a difficulty in developing and/or maintaining an aiming solution in response to a visuomotor perturbation. We suggest that this dual deficit can be explained by the cerebellum forming part of a network that learns and maintains action-outcome associations across trials. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Individuals with cerebellar pathology are impaired in sensorimotor adaptation. This deficit has been attributed to an impairment in error-based learning, specifically, from a deficit in using sensory prediction errors to update an internal model. Here we show that these individuals also have difficulty in discovering an aiming solution to overcome their adaptation deficit, suggesting a new role for the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation tasks. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={When sensory feedback is perturbed, accurate movement is restored by a combination of implicit processes and deliberate reaiming to strategically compensate for errors. Here, we directly compare two methods used previously to dissociate implicit from explicit learning on a trial-by-trial basis: 1) asking participants to report the direction that they aim their movements, and contrasting this with the directions of the target and the movement that they actually produce, and 2) manipulating movement preparation time. By instructing participants to reaim without a sensory perturbation, we show that reaiming is possible even with the shortest possible preparation times, particularly when targets are narrowly distributed. Nonetheless, reaiming is effortful and comes at the cost of increased variability, so we tested whether constraining preparation time is sufficient to suppress strategic reaiming during adaptation to visuomotor rotation with a broad target distribution. The rate and extent of error reduction under preparation time constraints were similar to estimates of implicit learning obtained from self-report without time pressure, suggesting that participants chose not to apply a reaiming strategy to correct visual errors under time pressure. Surprisingly, participants who reported aiming directions showed less implicit learning according to an alternative measure, obtained during trials performed without visual feedback. This suggests that the process of reporting can affect the extent or persistence of implicit learning. The data extend existing evidence that restricting preparation time can suppress explicit reaiming and provide an estimate of implicit visuomotor rotation learning that does not require participants to report their aiming directions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY During sensorimotor adaptation, implicit error-driven learning can be isolated from explicit strategy-driven reaiming by subtracting self-reported aiming directions from movement directions, or by restricting movement preparation time. Here, we compared the two methods. Restricting preparation times did not eliminate reaiming but was sufficient to suppress reaiming during adaptation with widely distributed targets. The self-report method produced a discrepancy in implicit learning estimated by subtracting aiming directions and implicit learning measured in no-feedback trials. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to examine the modification of postural symmetry during quiet standing using a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm. A group of neurologically typical adult participants performed a visually guided mediolateral (left–right) weight shifting task requiring precise adjustments in body orientation. During one phase of the task, the visual feedback of center of pressure (COP) was systematically biased toward the left or the right, requiring an adjustment in posture to compensate. COP during quiet standing without visual feedback was examined prior to and immediately following the sensorimotor adaptation procedure, in order to observe whether compensatory adjustments in postural control resulting from the visual-feedback manipulation would transfer to the control of whole-body COP during quiet standing. Results showed that the sensorimotor adaptation procedure induced a small but reliable compensatory change in the stance of participants, resulting in a change in postural symmetry and control that was found to persist even after normal visual feedback was restored. © 2017 IBRO},

abstract={Here we provide an overview of findings and viewpoints on the mechanisms of sensorimotor learning presented at the 2016 Biomechanics and Neural Control of Movement (BANCOM) conference in Deer Creek, OH. This field has shown substantial growth in the past couple of decades. For example it is now well accepted that neural systems outside of primary motor pathways play a role in learning. Frontoparietal and anterior cingulate networks contribute to sensorimotor adaptation, reflecting strategic aspects of exploration and learning. Longer term training results in functional and morphological changes in primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Interestingly, re-engagement of strategic processes once a skill has become well learned may disrupt performance. Efforts to predict individual differences in learning rate have enhanced our understanding of the neural, behavioral, and genetic factors underlying skilled human performance. Access to genomic analyses has dramatically increased over the past several years. This has enhanced our understanding of cellular processes underlying the expression of human behavior, including involvement of various neurotransmitters, receptors, and enzymes. Surprisingly our field has been slow to adopt such approaches in studying neural control, although this work does require much larger sample sizes than are typically used to investigate skill learning. We advocate that individual differences approaches can lead to new insights into human sensorimotor performance. Moreover, a greater understanding of the factors underlying the wide range of performance capabilities seen across individuals can promote personalized medicine and refinement of rehabilitation strategies, which stand to be more effective than "one size fits all" treatments. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Generalization is a fundamental aspect of behavior, allowing for the transfer of knowledge from one context to another. The details of this transfer are thought to reveal how the brain represents what it learns. Generalization has been a central focus in studies of sensorimotor adaptation, and its pattern has been well characterized: Learning of new dynamic and kinematic transformations in one region of space tapers off in a Gaussian-like fashion to neighboring untrained regions, echoing tuned population codes in the brain. In contrast to common allusions to generalization in cognitive science, generalization in visually guided reaching is usually framed as a passive consequence of neural tuning functions rather than a cognitive feature of learning. While previous research has presumed that maximum generalization occurs at the instructed task goal or the actual movement direction, recent work suggests that maximum generalization may occur at the location of an explicitly accessible movement plan. Here we provide further support for plan-based generalization, formalize this theory in an updated model of adaptation, and test several unexpected implications of the model. First, we employ a generalization paradigm to parameterize the generalization function and ascertain its maximum point. We then apply the derived generalization function to our model and successfully simulate and fit the time course of implicit adaptation across three behavioral experiments. We find that dynamics predicted by plan-based generalization are borne out in the data, are contrary to what traditional models predict, and lead to surprising implications for the behavioral, computational, and neural characteristics of sensorimotor adaptation. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Neurophysiological and neuroimaging work suggests that the cerebellum is critically involved in sensorimotor adaptation. Changes in cerebellar function alter behaviour when compensating for sensorimotor perturbations, as shown by non-invasive stimulation of the cerebellum and studies involving patients with cerebellar degeneration. It is known, however, that behavioural responses to sensorimotor perturbations reflect both explicit processes (such as volitional aiming to one side of a target to counteract a rotation of visual feedback) and implicit, error-driven updating of sensorimotor maps. The contribution of the cerebellum to these explicit and implicit processes remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of the cerebellum in sensorimotor adaptation to a 30 rotation of visual feedback of hand position during target-reaching, when the capacity to use explicit processes was manipulated by controlling movement preparation times. Explicit re-aiming was suppressed in one condition by requiring subjects to initiate their movements within 300ms of target presentation, and permitted in another condition by requiring subjects to wait approximately 1050ms after target presentation before movement initiation. Similar to previous work, applying anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS; 1.5mA) to the right cerebellum during adaptation resulted in faster compensation for errors imposed by the rotation. After exposure to the rotation, we evaluated implicit remapping in no-feedback trials after providing participants with explicit knowledge that the rotation had been removed. Crucially, movements were more adapted in these no-feedback trials following cerebellar anodal tDCS than after sham stimulation in both long and short preparation groups. Thus, cerebellar anodal tDCS increased implicit remapping during sensorimotor adaptation, irrespective of preparation time constraints. The results are consistent with the possibility that the cerebellum contributes to the formation of new visuomotor maps that correct perturbations in sensory feedback, even when explicit processes are suppressed during sensorimotor adaptation. © 2017 Leow et al.

abstract={Postural control involves the use of sensory cues that must be properly integrated to provide specific information to accommodate continuous changes in the environment. Studies have shown several features of adaptive sensorimotor behavior, but many of the mechanisms are still unknown, such as perdurable effects. The purpose of the present study was to examine the lasting effects of visual reweighting adaptation on postural control in young adults. Seventeen young adults were exposed to a moving room situation in 3 experimental sessions that occurred on different occasions. In the first occasion, participants were exposed to seven 60-s trials, in which the room oscillated sinusoidally (0.2 Hz). The first 3 trials and last 3 trials had an amplitude of 0.6 cm and velocity of 0.6 cm/s (peak-to-peak). The fourth trial had an amplitude of 3.5 cm and velocity of 3.5 cm/s (change trial). In the second and third occasions, 1 and 7 days after the first occasion, respectively, the participants performed 3 trials with the room moving with the same parameters as the first trial in the first occasion. The results indicated that the abrupt increases in amplitude and velocity led to a less coherent and smaller magnitude of postural response to the moving room. The reduction of the induced postural response that was caused by visual manipulation lasted at least 1 week. These results suggest that adaptive changes that are caused by environmental changes are maintained for a relatively long period of time in young adults. © 2017 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation occurs when there is a discrepancy between the expected and actual sensory consequences of a movement. This learning can be precisely measured, but its source has been hard to pin down because standard adaptation tasks introduce two potential learning signals: task performance errors and sensory prediction errors. Here we employed a new method that induces sensory prediction errors without task performance errors. This method combines the use of clamped visual feedback that is angularly offset from the target and independent of the direction of motion, along with instructions to ignore this feedback while reaching to targets. Despite these instructions, participants unknowingly showed robust adaptation of their movements. This adaptation was similar to that observed with standard methods, showing sign dependence, local generalization, and cerebellar dependency. Surprisingly, adaptation rate and magnitude were invariant across a large range of offsets. Collectively, our results challenge current models of adaptation and demonstrate that behavior observed in many studies of adaptation reflect the composite effects of task performance and sensory prediction errors. © 2017 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract={Response inhibition has been suggested to be dysfunctional in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, this process involves intentional cognitive control, which does not correspond to the automatic emergence of stereotyped thoughts and behaviours usually reported by patients with OCD. In the present study, the excessive facilitation of unintentional processes was assessed in OCD by using the Computerized Mirror Pointing Task (CMPT). Seventy-six volunteers participated in this study, including 39 patients with OCD and 37 healthy controls. The CMPT was administered to all participants, and a score of appropriateness of the sensorimotor adaptation to the mirror inversion was computed from the initial deviation angle (IDA), that precedes the intentional readjustment of movement. Results showed that throughout the 40 trials of the CMPT, the IDA score remained significantly abnormal in patients with OCD in comparison with control participants. Further analyses of IDA scores in OCD revealed a clear tendency to keep a natural visuomotor processing that is rigid and unadapted to the mirror condition. Irrespective of the physical requirements of the environment, patients with OCD showed a strong tendency to initiate movements as per a previously consolidated - although unadapted - sensorimotor mapping. This suggests a tendency for an excessive facilitation of unintentional stereotyped processes. Further studies should be conducted on this question by using tasks sensitive to cognitive processes other than visuo-spatial abilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This study aimed to investigate the procedural deficit hypothesis (PDH) in children with specific language impairment (SLI) by using a mirror-drawing task, a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm that does not involve sequence learning and has never before been used in SLI. A total of 30 school-aged children with SLI matched to 30 typically developing (TD) control children had to trace several figures seen only in mirror-reversed view in two practice sessions separated by a one-week interval. Two practice conditions were compared: a constant condition in which children had to trace the same figure throughout the learning trials, and a variable one in which they had to trace different figures in each trial. The results revealed a similar learning pattern between SLI and TD children in both practice conditions, suggesting that initial learning for a non-sequential procedural task is preserved in SLI. However, the children with SLI generalized the mirror-drawing skill in the same way as the TD children only if there was variability in the way the material was trained (variable practice). No significant schedule effects were observed in the control group. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Previous studies have revealed that visual and somatosensory information is processed as a function of its relevance during movement execution. We thus performed spectral decompositions of ongoing neural activities within the somatosensory and visual areas while human participants performed a complex visuomotor task. In this task, participants followed the outline of irregular polygons with a pen-controlled cursor. At unpredictable times, the motion of the cursor deviated 120° with respect to the actual pen position creating an incongruence between visual and somatosensory inputs, thus increasing the importance of visual feedback to control the movement as suggested in previous studies. We found that alpha and beta power significantly decreased in the visual cortex during sensory incongruence when compared to unperturbed conditions. This result is in line with an increased gain of visual inputs during sensory incongruence. In parallel, we also found a simultaneous decrease of gamma and beta power in sensorimotor areas which has not been reported previously. The gamma desynchronization suggests a reduced integration of somatosensory inputs for controlling movements with sensory incongruence while beta ERD could be more specifically linked to sensorimotor adaptation processes. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The acoustic realization of speech is constrained by the physical mechanisms by which it is produced. Yet for speech perception, the degree to which listeners utilize experience derived from speech production has long been debated. In the present study, we examined how sensorimotor adaptation during production may affect perception, and how this relationship may be reflected in early vs. late electrophysiological responses. Participants first performed a baseline speech production task, followed by a vowel categorization task during which EEG responses were recorded. In a subsequent speech production task, half the participants received shifted auditory feedback, leading most to alter their articulations. This was followed by a second, post-training vowel categorization task. We compared changes in vowel production to both behavioral and electrophysiological changes in vowel perception. No differences in phonetic categorization were observed between groups receiving altered or unaltered feedback. However, exploratory analyses revealed correlations between vocal motor behavior and phonetic categorization. EEG analyses revealed correlations between vocal motor behavior and cortical responses in both early and late time windows. These results suggest that participants' recent production behavior influenced subsequent vowel perception. We suggest that the change in perception can be best characterized as a mapping of acoustics onto articulation. © 2017 Schuerman, Meyer and McQueen.},

abstract={A given speech sound will be realized differently depending on the context in which it is produced. Listeners have been found to compensate perceptually for these coarticulatory effects, yet it is unclear to what extent this effect depends on actual production experience. In this study, whether changes in motor-to-sound mappings induced by adaptation to altered auditory feedback can affect perceptual compensation for coarticulation is investigated. Specifically, whether altering how the vowel [i] is produced can affect the categorization of a stimulus continuum between an alveolar and a palatal fricative whose interpretation is dependent on vocalic context is tested. It was found that participants could be sorted into three groups based on whether they tended to oppose the direction of the shifted auditory feedback, to follow it, or a mixture of the two, and that these articulatory responses, not the shifted feedback the participants heard, correlated with changes in perception. These results indicate that sensorimotor adaptation to altered feedback can affect the perception of unaltered yet coarticulatorily-dependent speech sounds, suggesting a modulatory role of sensorimotor experience on speech perception. © 2017 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Saccadic adaptation can be used to study disturbances of sensory processing and motor learning. We investigated whether patients with schizophrenia can adjust saccadic amplitudes to account for an increase in visual error while the saccade is in flight, and whether they transfer this change to a visuo-manual localization task. Fourteen patients (mean 37.1 years) and 14 healthy controls (mean 35.1 years) performed 200 adaptation trials of 10° with target shifts of 4° in the outward direction. We determined the percent amplitude change during adaptation and adaptation speed. In addition, subjects localized a stimulus that was flashed 50 ms after saccade target onset to measure the transfer of change in visual space perception to visuo-manual coordination. Eye movements were recorded at 1000 Hz. Saccade amplitudes increased over adaptation trials by 11 % (p < 0.001) similarly in both groups. Amplitude variability during adaptation was higher in patients (1.06° ± 0.32°) than in controls (0.71° ± 0.14°; p = 0.001), while adaptation speed was slower in patients (0.02 ± 0.03) than in controls (0.11 ± 0.11; p = 0.01). Other pre- and post-adaptation saccade metrics did not differ between groups. The adaptation process shifted localization of the flashed target in the adaptation direction similarly in both groups. The use of error signals for the internal recalibration of sensorimotor systems and the transfer of this recalibration to visual space perception appear basically unimpaired in schizophrenia. Higher amplitude variability in patients suggests a certain instability of saccadic control in cerebellar systems. Patients seem to rely on visual error processing in frontal circuitry, resulting in slower adaptation speeds, despite unimpaired adaptation strength. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Adaptation learning is crucial to maintain precise motor control in face of environmental perturbations. Although much progress has been made in understanding the psychophysics and neurophysiology of sensorimotor adaptation (SA), the time course of memory consolidation remains elusive. The lack of a reproducible gradient of memory resistance using protocols of retrograde interference has even led to the proposal that memories produced through SA do not consolidate. Here, we pursued an alternative approach using resting-state fMRI to track changes in functional connectivity (FC) induced by learning. Given that consolidation leads to long-term memory,we hypothesized that a change in FC that predicted long-termmemory but not shortterm memory would provide indirect evidence for memory stabilization. Six scans were acquired before, 15 min, 1, 3, 5.5, and 24 h after training on a center-out task under veridical or distorted visual feedback. The experimental group showed an increment in FC of a network including motor, premotor, posterior parietal cortex, cerebellum, and putamen that peaked at 5.5 h. Crucially, the strengthening of this network correlated positively with long-term retention but negatively with short-term retention. Our work provides evidence, suggesting that adaptation memories stabilize within a 6-h window, and points to different mechanisms subserving short- and long-term memory. © The Author 2015.},

abstract={The current study examined the augmentation of error feedback on visuomotor adaptability in older adults with varying degrees of cognitive decline (assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment; MoCA). Twenty-three participants performed a center-out computerized visuomotor adaptation task when the visual feedback of their hand movement error was presented in a regular (ratio = 1:1) or enhanced (ratio = 1:2) error feedback schedule. Results showed that older adults with lower scores on the MoCA had less adaptability than those with higher MoCA scores during the regular feedback schedule. However, participants demonstrated similar adaptability during the enhanced feedback schedule, regardless of their cognitive ability. Furthermore, individuals with lower MoCA scores showed larger after-effects in spatial control during the enhanced schedule compared to the regular schedule, whereas individuals with higher MoCA scores displayed the opposite pattern. Additional neuro-cognitive assessments revealed that spatial working memory and processing speed were positively related to motor adaptability during the regular scheduled but negatively related to adaptability during the enhanced schedule. We argue that individuals with mild cognitive decline employed different adaptation strategies when encountering enhanced visual feedback, suggesting older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may benefit from enhanced visual error feedback during sensorimotor adaptation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={To accurately guide one's actions online, the brain predicts sensory action feedback ahead of time based on internal models, which can be updated by sensory prediction errors. The underlying operations can be experimentally investigated in sensorimotor adaptation tasks, in which moving under perturbed sensory action feedback requires internal model updates. Here we altered healthy participants’ visual hand movement feedback in a virtual reality setup, while assessing brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants tracked a continually moving virtual target object with a photorealistic, three-dimensional (3D) virtual hand controlled online via a data glove. During the continuous tracking task, the virtual hand's movements (i.e., visual movement feedback) were repeatedly periodically delayed, which participants had to compensate for to maintain accurate tracking. This realistic task design allowed us to simultaneously investigate processes likely operating at several levels of the brain's motor control hierarchy. FMRI revealed that the length of visual feedback delay was parametrically reflected by activity in the inferior parietal cortex and posterior temporal cortex. Unpredicted changes in visuomotor mapping (at transitions from synchronous to delayed visual feedback periods or vice versa) activated biological motion-sensitive regions in the lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC). Activity in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), focused on the contralateral anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), correlated with tracking error, whereby this correlation was stronger in participants with higher tracking performance. Our results are in line with recent proposals of a wide-spread cortical motor control hierarchy, where temporoparietal regions seem to evaluate visuomotor congruence and thus possibly ground a self-attribution of movements, the LOTC likely processes early visual prediction errors, and the aIPS computes action goal errors and possibly corresponding motor corrections. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={In standard taxonomies, motor skills are typically treated as representative of implicit or procedural memory. We examined two emblematic tasks of implicit motor learning, sensorimotor adaptation and sequence learning, asking whether individual differences in learning are correlated between these tasks, as well as how individual differences within each task are related to different performance variables. As a prerequisite, it was essential to establish the reliability of learning measures for each task. Participants were tested twice on a visuomotor adaptation task and on a sequence learning task, either the serial reaction time task or the alternating reaction time task. Learning was evident in all tasks at the group level and reliable at the individual level in visuomotor adaptation and the alternating reaction time task but not in the serial reaction time task. Performance variability was predictive of learning in both domains, yet the relationship was in the opposite direction for adaptation and sequence learning. For the former, faster learning was associated with lower variability, consistent with models of sensorimotor adaptation in which learning rates are sensitive to noise. For the latter, greater learning was associated with higher variability and slower reaction times, factors that may facilitate the spread of activation required to form predictive, sequential associations. Interestingly, learning measures of the different tasks were not correlated. Together, these results oppose a shared process for implicit learning in sensorimotor adaptation and sequence learning and provide insight into the factors that account for individual differences in learning within each task domain. New & Noteworthy We investigated individual differences in the ability to implicitly learn motor skills. As a prerequisite, we assessed whether individual differences were reliable across test sessions. We found that two commonly used tasks of implicit learning, visuomotor adaptation and the alternating serial reaction time task, exhibited good test-retest reliability in measures of learning and performance. However, the learning measures did not correlate between the two tasks, arguing against a shared process for implicit motor learning. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={We have previously reported that visuospatial working memory performance and magnitude of activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex predict the rate of visuomotor adaptation. Recent behavioral studies suggest that sensorimotor savings, or faster relearning on second exposure to a task, are due to recall of these early, strategic components of adaptation. In the present study we applied anodal transcranial direct current stimulation to right or left prefrontal cortex or left motor cortex. We found that all groups adapted dart throwing movements while wearing prism lenses at the same rate as subjects receiving sham stimulation on day 1. On test day 2, which was conducted a few days later, the right prefrontal and left motor cortex groups adapted faster than the sham group. Moreover, only the right prefrontal group exhibited greater savings, expressed as a greater difference between day 1 and day 2 errors, compared with sham stimulation. These findings support the hypothesis that the right prefrontal cortex contributes to sensorimotor adaptation and savings. New & Noteworthy We have previously reported that visuospatial working memory performance and magnitude of activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex predict the rate of manual visuomotor adaptation. Sensorimotor savings, or faster adaptation to a previously experienced perturbation, has been recently linked to cognitive processes. We show that facilitating the right prefrontal cortex with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation enhances sensorimotor savings compared with sham stimulation. © 2017 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Humans undergo extensive sensorimotor adaptation during spaceflight due to altered vestibular inputs and body unloading. No studies have yet evaluated the effects of spaceflight on human brain structure despite the fact that recently reported optic nerve structural changes are hypothesized to occur due to increased intracranial pressure occurring with microgravity. This is the first report on human brain structural changes with spaceflight. We evaluated retrospective longitudinal T2-weighted MRI scans and balance data from 27 astronauts (thirteen ~2-week shuttle crew members and fourteen ~6-month International Space Station crew members) to determine spaceflight effects on brain structure, and whether any pre to postflight brain changes are associated with balance changes. Data were obtained from the NASA Lifetime Surveillance of Astronaut Health. Brain scans were segmented into gray matter maps and normalized into MNI space using a stepwise approach through subject specific templates. Non-parametric permutation testing was used to analyze pre to postflight volumetric gray matter changes. We found extensive volumetric gray matter decreases, including large areas covering the temporal and frontal poles and around the orbits. This effect was larger in International Space Station versus shuttle crew members in some regions. There were bilateral focal gray matter increases within the medial primary somatosensory and motor cortex; i.e., the cerebral areas where the lower limbs are represented. These intriguing findings are observed in a retrospective data set; future prospective studies should probe the underlying mechanisms and behavioral consequences. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={Motor responses to unexpected external perturbations require the adjustment of the motor commands driving the ongoing activity. Strategies can be learned with practice to compensate for these unpredictable perturbations (e.g., externally induced slips and trips). It has been hypothesized that response improvements reflect the adaptation of motor commands through updates of an internal model. This hypothesis may be nuanced when a pre-existing motor response could be used. In that case, since a relatively adequate response is known, only the timing of the command needs to be determined. If so, then it could be inferred that the timing of movement initiation and the specific sequence of motor commands can be dissociated. Previously, we quantified the benefits of cuing vs. learning on recovery motor responses resulting from a trip induced by the abrupt stop of one side of a split belt treadmill. Trip occurrence was randomized within a series of strides. Two groups of young adults participated to two distinct experiments (learning, cuing). In the learning experiment, trip recovery improved progressively from the 4th to the 8th trial to reach an “adapted response”. In the cuing experiment, trip recovery was immediate (from 1st trial). Expanding from these results, the aim of the present work was to differentiate the processes underlying the generation of motor compensation strategies in response to an external perturbation under time uncertainty. A supplementary analysis revealed that “cued” responses were kinematically similar to the “adapted response” and remained invariant regardless of cue lead time (250, 500 ms before trip) and application location of the cue (arm, trunk, lower leg). It is posited that all responses (cued and non-cued) are the expression of a pre-existing motor program derived from life experiences. Here, the cue significantly reduces time uncertainty and adaptation consists primarily in resolving time uncertainty based on the trial-by-trial learning of the stochastic property of trip occurrence in order to reduce the response delay. Hence, response time delay and motor program parameters appear to stem from two distinct processes. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation, the process that reduces movement errors by learning from sensory feedback, is often studied within a session of about half an hour. Within such a single session, adaptation generally reaches plateau before errors are completely removed. However, adaptation may complete on longer timescales: the slow components of error-based adaptation are associated with good retention. In this study, we tested how adaptation evolves over time by asking participants to perform six adaptation sessions on different days. In these sessions, participants performed a three-dimensional reaching task while visual feedback about endpoint errors was rotated around the cyclopean eye. In addition, context specificity of the adaptation was addressed by measuring inter-limb transfer and transfer to visual and proprioceptive perceptual tasks. We show that from the second session on, the adaptation was retained almost completely across sessions. However, after six learning sessions, adaptation still reached plateau before errors were completely removed. The adaptation was specific: the adaptation did neither transfer to the other hand, nor to the visual, and only marginally to the proprioceptive perceptual estimates. We conclude that motor adaptation is robust, specific and incomplete. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation can be induced by action observation, and also by passive training. Here, we investigated the effect of a protocol that combined action observation and passive training on visuomotor adaptation, by comparing it with the effect of action observation or passive training alone. Subjects were divided into five conditions during the training session: (1) action observation, in which the subjects watched a video of a model who adapted to a novel visuomotor rotation; (2) proprioceptive training, in which the subject's arm was moved passively to target locations that were associated with desired trajectories; (3) combined training, in which the subjects watched the video of a model during a half of the session and experienced passive movements during the other half; (4) active training, in which the subjects adapted actively to the rotation; and (5) a control condition, in which the subjects did not perform any task. Following that session, all subjects adapted to the same visuomotor rotation. Results showed that the subjects in the combined training condition adapted to the rotation significantly better than those in the observation or proprioceptive training condition, although their performance was not as good as that of those who adapted actively. These findings suggest that although a protocol that combines action observation and passive training consists of all the processes involved in active training (error detection and correction, effector-specific and proprioceptively based reaching movements), these processes in that protocol may work differently as compared to a protocol in which the same processes are engaged actively. © 2016 IBRO},

abstract={The process of sensorimotor adaptation is considered to be driven by errors. While sensory prediction errors, defined as the difference between the planned and the actual movement of the cursor, drive implicit learning processes, target errors (e.g., the distance of the cursor from the target) are thought to drive explicit learning mechanisms. This distinction was mainly studied in the context of arm reaching tasks where the position and the size of the target were constant. We hypothesize that in a dynamic reaching environment, where subjects have to hit moving targets and the targets’ dynamic characteristics affect task success, implicit processes will benefit from target errors as well. We examine the effect of target errors on learning of an unnoticed perturbation during unconstrained reaching movements. Subjects played a Pong game, in which they had to hit a moving ball by moving a paddle controlled by their hand. During the game, the movement of the paddle was gradually rotated with respect to the hand, reaching a final rotation of 25°. Subjects were assigned to one of two groups: The high-target error group played the Pong with a small ball, and the low-target error group played with a big ball. Before and after the Pong game, subjects performed open-loop reaching movements toward static targets with no visual feedback. While both groups adapted to the rotation, the postrotation reaching movements were directionally biased only in the small-ball group. This result provides evidence that implicit adaptation is sensitive to target errors. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={When listeners encounter speech under adverse listening conditions, adaptive adjustments in perceptioncan improve comprehension over time. In some cases, these adaptive changes require the presence ofexternal information that disambiguates the distorted speech signals, whereas in other cases mereexposure is sufficient. Both external (e.g., written feedback) and internal (e.g., prior word knowledge)sources of information can be used to generate predictions about the correct mapping of a distortedspeech signal. We hypothesize that these predictions provide a basis for determining the discrepancybetween the expected and actual speech signal that can be used to guide adaptive changes in perception.This study provides the first empirical investigation that manipulates external and internal factors through(a) the availability of explicit external disambiguating information via the presence or absence ofpostresponse orthographic information paired with a repetition of the degraded stimulus, and (b) theaccuracy of internally generated predictions; an acoustic distortion is introduced either abruptly orincrementally. The results demonstrate that the impact of external information on adaptive plasticity iscontingent upon whether the intelligibility of the stimuli permits accurate internally generated predictionsduring exposure. External information sources enhance adaptive plasticity only when input signals areseverely degraded and cannot reliably access internal predictions. This is consistent with a computationalframework for adaptive plasticity in which error-driven supervised learning relies on the ability tocompute sensory prediction error signals from both internal and external sources of information. © 2016 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Two key features of sensorimotor adaptation are the directional selectivity of adaptive changes and the interference of adaptations to opposite directions. The present study investigated whether directional selectivity and interference of adaptation are related to executive functions and whether these phenomena differ between two methods for visuomotor adaptation. Subjects adapted at three target directions to clockwise or counterclockwise rotated feedback or to clockwise or counterclockwise target displacements (double steps). Both adaptation methods induce rotations of movement trajectories into the same direction, but provide visual information differently. The results showed that adaptation progressed differently between three targets. When movements adapted clockwise, adaptation was best at the most clockwise located target, and when movements adapted counterclockwise, it was best at the most counterclockwise located target, suggesting that spatial generalization between target directions is related to the direction of motor adaptation. The two adaptation methods produced different adaptation patterns, which indicate a further impact of visual information. A second adaptation to the other and opposite-directed discordance was worse than naive adaptation and washed out the aftereffects from the first adaptation, confirming that both adaptation methods interfered. Executive functions were significant covariate for overall interference and interference of target-specific adaptation. The results suggest that directional selectivity of adaptation is shaped by the direction of motor adaptation and the visual information provided. The interference of both adaptation methods indicates that they share adaptive mechanisms for recalibration. The interference is the lower the better subjects are able to cognitively switch between tasks and to inhibit prepotent responses. Therefore, cognitive functions seem to be involved in the inhibition of non-adequate sensorimotor responses. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Although emotion is known to reciprocally interact with cognitive and motor performance, contemporary theories of motor learning do not specifically consider how dynamic variations in a learner’s affective state may influence motor performance during motor learning. Using a prism adaptation paradigm, we assessed emotion during motor learning on a trial-by-trial basis. We designed two dart-throwing experiments to dissociate motor performance and reward outcomes by giving participants maximum points for accurate throws and reduced points for throws that hit zones away from the target (i.e., “accidental points”). Experiment 1 dissociated motor performance from emotional responses and found that affective ratings tracked points earned more closely than error magnitude. Further, both reward and error uniquely contributed to motor learning, as indexed by the change in error from one trial to the next. Experiment 2 manipulated accidental point locations vertically, whereas prism displacement remained horizontal. Results demonstrated that reward could bias motor performance even when concurrent sensorimotor adaptation was taking place in a perpendicular direction. Thus, these experiments demonstrate that affective states were dissociable from error magnitude during motor learning and that affect more closely tracked points earned. Our findings further implicate reward as another factor, other than error, that contributes to motor learning, suggesting the importance of incorporating affective states into models of motor learning. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Visual uncertainty may affect saccade adaptation in two complementary ways. First, an ideal adaptor should take into account the reliability of visual information for determining the amount of correction, predicting that increasing visual uncertainty should decrease adaptation rates. We tested this by comparing observers’ direction discrimination and adaptation rates in an intra-saccadic-step paradigm. Second, clearly visible target steps may generate a slower adaptation rate since the error can be attributed to an external cause, instead of an internal change in the visuo-motor mapping that needs to be compensated. We tested this prediction by measuring saccade adaptation to different step sizes. Most remarkably, we found little correlation between estimates of visual uncertainty and adaptation rates and no slower adaptation rates with more visible step sizes. Additionally, we show that for low contrast targets backward steps are perceived as stationary after the saccade, but that adaptation rates are independent of contrast. We suggest that the saccadic system uses different position signals for adapting dysmetric saccades and for generating a trans-saccadic stable visual percept, explaining that saccade adaptation is found to be independent of visual uncertainty. © 2016 Souto, Gegenfurtner and Schütz.},

abstract={Cerebral Palsy (CP) results from an insult to the developing brain and is associated with deficits in locomotor and manual skills and in sensorimotor adaptation. We hypothesized that the poor sensorimotor adaptation in persons with CP is related to their high execution variability and does not reflect a general impairment in adaptation learning. We studied the interaction between performance variability and adaptation deficits using a multi-session locomotor adaptation design in persons with CP. Six adolescents with diplegic CP were exposed, during a period of 15 weeks, to a repeated split-belt treadmill perturbation spread over 30 sessions and were tested again 6 months after the end of training. Compared to age-matched healthy controls, subjects with CP showed poor adaptation and high execution variability in the first exposure to the perturbation. Following training they showed marked reduction in execution variability and an increase in learning rates. The reduction in variability and the improvement in adaptation were highly correlated in the CP group and were retained 6 months after training. Interestingly, despite reducing their variability in the washout phase, subjects with CP did not improve learning rates during washout phases that were introduced only four times during the experiment. Our results suggest that locomotor adaptation in subjects with CP is related to their execution variability. Nevertheless, while variability reduction is generalized to other locomotor contexts, the development of savings requires both reduction in execution variability and multiple exposures to the perturbation. © 2016 Mawase, Bar-Haim, Joubran, Rubin, Karniel and Shmuelof.},

abstract={Much has been revealed concerning human motor learning at the behavioral level [1, 2], but less is known about changes in the involved neural circuits and signals. By examining muscle spindle responses during a classic visuomotor adaptation task [3-6] performed by fully alert humans, I found substantial modulation of sensory afferent signals as a function of adaptation state. Specifically, spindle control was independent of concurrent muscle activity but was specific to movement direction (representing muscle lengthening versus shortening) and to different stages of learning. Increased spindle afferent responses to muscle stretch occurring early during learning reflected individual error size and were negatively related to subsequent antagonist activity (i.e., 60-80 ms thereafter). Relative increases in tonic afferent output early during learning were predictive of the subjects' adaptation rate. I also found that independent spindle control during sensory realignment (the "washout" stage) induced afferent signal "linearization" with respect to muscle length (i.e., signals were more tuned to hand position). The results demonstrate for the first time that motor learning also involves independent and state-related modulation of sensory mechanoreceptor signals. The current findings suggest that adaptive motor performance also relies on the independent control of sensors, not just of muscles. I propose that the "γ" motor system innervating spindles acts to facilitate the acquisition and extraction of task-relevant information at the early stages of sensorimotor adaptation. This designates a more active and targeted role for the human proprioceptive system during motor learning. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The interactive association of age and dopaminergic polymorphisms on cognitive function has been studied extensively. However, there is limited research on whether age interacts with the association between genetic polymorphisms and motor learning. We examined a group of young and older adults' performance in three motor tasks: explicit sequence learning, visuomotor adaptation, and grooved pegboard. We assessed whether individuals' motor learning and performance were associated with their age and genotypes. We selected three genetic polymorphisms: Catechol-O-Methyl Transferase (COMT val158met) and Dopamine D2 Receptor (DRD2 G>T), which are involved with dopaminergic regulation, and Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF val66met) that modulates neuroplasticity and has been shown to interact with dopaminergic genes. Although the underlying mechanisms of the function of these three genotypes are different, the high performance alleles of each have been linked to better learning and performance. We created a composite polygene score based on the Number of High Performance Alleles (NHPA) that each individual carried. We found several associations between genetic profile, motor performance, and sensorimotor adaptation. More importantly, we found that this association varies with age, task type, and engagement of implicit versus explicit learning processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Different processes are involved during visuomotor learning, including an error-based procedural and a strategy based cognitive mechanism. Our objective was to analyze if the changes in the adaptation or the aftereffect components of visuomotor learning measured across development, reflected different maturation rates of the aforementioned mechanisms. Ninety-five healthy children aged 4-12. years and a group of young adults participated in a wedge prism and a dove prism throwing task, which laterally displace or horizontally reverse the visual field respectively. The results show that despite the age-related differences in motor control, all children groups adapted in the error-based wedge prisms condition. However, when removing the prism, small children showed a slower aftereffects extinction rate. On the strategy-based visual reversing task only the older children group reached adult-like levels. These results are consistent with the idea of different mechanisms with asynchronous maturation rates participating during visuomotor learning. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Visuomotor adaptation declines in older age. This has been attributed to cognitive impairments. One relevant cognitive function could be creativity, since creativity is implicated as mediator of early learning. The present study therefore evaluates whether two aspects of creativity, divergent and convergent thinking, are differentially involved in the age-dependent decline of visuomotor adaptation.In 25 young and 24 older volunteers, divergent thinking was assessed by the alternative-uses-task (AUT), convergent thinking by the Intelligenz-Struktur-Test-2000 (IST), and sensorimotor-adaptation by a pointing task with 60° rotated visual feedback.Young participants outperformed older participants in all three tasks. AUT scores were positively associated with young but not older participants' adaptive performance, whereas IST scores were negatively associated with older but not young participants' adaptive performance. This pattern of findings could be attributed to a consistent relationship between AUT, IST and adaptation; taking this into account, adaptation deficits of older participants were no longer significant.We conclude that divergent thinking supports workaround-strategies during adaptation, but doesn't influence visuomotor recalibration. Furthermore, the decay of divergent thinking in older adults may explain most of age-related decline of adaptive strategies. When the age-related decay of divergent thinking coincides with well-preserved convergent thinking, adaptation suffers most. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Adaptation of fingertip forces to friction at the grasping surface is necessary to prevent use of inadequate or excessive grip forces. In the current study we investigated the effect of blocking tactile information from the fingertips noninvasively on the adaptation and efficiency of grip forces to surface friction during precision grasp. Ten neurologically intact subjects grasped and lifted an instrumented grip device with 18 different frictional surfaces under three conditions: with bare hands or with a thin layer of plastic (Tegaderm) or an additional layer of foam affixed to the fingertips. The coefficient of friction at the finger-object interface of each surface was obtained for each subject with bare hands and Tegaderm by measuring the slip ratio (grip force/load force) at the moment of slip. We found that the foam layer reduced sensibility for two-point discrimination and pressure sensitivity at the fingertips, but Tegaderm did not. However, Tegaderm reduced static, but not dynamic, tactile discrimination. Adaptation of fingertip grip forces to surface friction measured by the rate of change of peak grip force, and grip force efficiency measured by the grip-load force ratio at lift, showed a proportional relationship with bare hands but were impaired with Tegaderm and foam. Activation of muscles engaged in precision grip also varied with the frictional surface with bare hands but not with Tegaderm and foam. The results suggest that sensitivity for static tactile discrimination is necessary for feedforward and feedback control of grip forces and for adaptive modulation of muscle activity during precision grasp. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={In sensorimotor adaptation tasks, feedback delays can cause significant reductions in the rate of learning. This constraint is puzzling given that many skilled behaviors have inherently long delays (e.g., hitting a golf ball). One difference in these task domains is that adaptation is primarily driven by error-based feedback, whereas skilled performance may also rely to a large extent on outcome-based feedback. This difference suggests that error- and outcome-based feedback may engage different learning processes, and these processes may be associated with different temporal constraints. We tested this hypothesis in a visuomotor adaptation task. Error feedback was indicated by the terminal position of a cursor, while outcome feedback was indicated by points. In separate groups of participants, the two feedback signals were presented immediately at the end of the movement, after a delay, or with just the error feedback delayed. Participants learned to counter the rotation in a similar manner regardless of feedback delay. However, the aftereffect, an indicator of implicit motor adaptation, was attenuated with delayed error feedback, consistent with the hypothesis that a different learning process supports performance under delay. We tested this by employing a task that dissociates the contribution of explicit strategies and implicit adaptation. We find that explicit aiming strategies contribute to the majority of the learning curve, regardless of delay; however, implicit learning, measured over the course of learning and by aftereffects, was significantly attenuated with delayed error-based feedback. These experiments offer new insight into the temporal constraints associated with different motor learning processes. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Beta oscillations are a dominant feature of the sensorimotor system. A transient and prominent increase in beta oscillations is consistently observed across the sensorimotor cortical-basal ganglia network after cessation of voluntary movement: the post-movement beta synchronization (PMBS). Current theories about the function of the PMBS have been focused on either the closure of motor response or the processing of sensory afferance. Computational models of sensorimotor control have emphasized the importance of the integration between feed forward estimation and sensory feedback, and therefore the putative motor and sensory functions of beta oscillations may reciprocally interact with each other and in fact be indissociable. Here we show that the amplitude of sensorimotor PMBS is modulated by the history of visual feedback of task-relevant errors, and negatively correlated with the trial-to-trial exploratory adjustment in a sensorimotor adaptation task in young healthy human subjects. The PMBS also negatively correlated with the uncertainty associated with the feedforward estimation, which was recursively updatedin light of new sensory feedback, as identified by a Bayesian learning model. These results reconcile the two opposing motor and sensory views of the function of PMBS, and suggest a unifying theory in which PMBS indexes the confidence in internal feedforward estimation in Bayesian sensorimotor integration. Its amplitude simultaneously reflects cortical sensory processing and signals the need for maintenance or adaptation of the motor output, and if necessary, exploration to identify an altered sensorimotor transformation. © 2016 Tan et al.},

abstract={A coordinate system is composed of an encoding, defining the dimensions of the space, and an origin. We examine the coordinate encoding used to update motor plans during sensory-motor adaptation to center-out reaches. Adaptation is induced using a novel paradigm in which feedback of reach endpoints is perturbed following a sinewave pattern over trials; the perturbed dimensions of the feedback were the axes of a Cartesian coordinate system in one session and a polar coordinate system in another session. For center-out reaches to randomly chosen target locations, reach errors observed at one target will require different corrections at other targets within Cartesian- and polar-coded systems. The sinewave adaptation technique allowed us to simultaneously adapt both dimensions of each coordinate system (x-y, or reach gain and angle), and identify the contributions of each perturbed dimension by adapting each at a distinct temporal frequency. The efficiency of this technique further allowed us to employ perturbations that were a fraction the size normally used, which avoids confounding automatic adaptive processes with deliberate adjustments made in response to obvious experimental manipulations. Subjects independently corrected errors in each coordinate in both sessions, suggesting that the nervous system encodes both a Cartesian- and polar-coordinate-based internal representation for motor adaptation. The gains and phase lags of the adaptive responses are not readily explained by current theories of sensory-motor adaptation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We examined whether adults with autism had difficulty imitating atypical biological kinematics. To reduce the impact that higher-order processes have on imitation we used a non-human agent model to control social attention, and removed end-state target goals in half of the trials to minimise goal-directed attention. Findings showed that only neurotypical adults imitated atypical biological kinematics. Adults with autism did, however, become significantly more accurate at imitating movement time. This confirmed they engaged in the task, and that sensorimotor adaptation was self-regulated. The attentional bias to movement time suggests the attenuation in imitating kinematics might be a compensatory strategy due to deficits in lower-level visuomotor processes associated with self-other mapping, or selective attention modulated the processes that represent biological kinematics. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Human locomotor adaptation requires feedback and feed-forward control processes to maintain an appropriate walking pattern. Adaptation may require the use of visual and proprioceptive input to decode altered movement dynamics and generate an appropriate response. After a person transfers from an extreme sensory environment and back, as astronauts do when they return from spaceflight, the prolonged period required for re-adaptation can pose a significant burden. In our previous paper, we showed that plantar tactile vibration during a split-belt adaptation task did not interfere with the treadmill adaptation however, larger overground transfer effects with a slower decay resulted. Such effects, in the absence of visual feedback (of motion) and perturbation of tactile feedback, are believed to be due to a higher proprioceptive gain because, in the absence of relevant external dynamic cues such as optic flow, reliance on body-based cues is enhanced during gait tasks through multisensory integration. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect of optic flow on tactile-stimulated split-belt adaptation as a paradigm to facilitate the sensorimotor adaptation process. Twenty healthy young adults, separated into two matched groups, participated in the study. All participants performed an overground walking trial followed by a split-belt treadmill adaptation protocol. The tactile group (TC) received vibratory plantar tactile stimulation only, whereas the virtual reality and tactile group (VRT) received an additional concurrent visual stimulation: a moving virtual corridor, inducing perceived self-motion. A post-treadmill overground trial was performed to determine adaptation transfer. Interlimb coordination of spatiotemporal and kinetic variables was quantified using symmetry indices and analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Marked changes of step length characteristics were observed in both groups during split-belt adaptation. Stance and swing time symmetries were similar in the two groups, suggesting that temporal parameters are not modified by optic flow. However, whereas the TC group displayed significant stance time asymmetries during the post-treadmill session, such aftereffects were absent in the VRT group. The results indicated that the enhanced transfer resulting from exposure to plantar cutaneous vibration during adaptation was alleviated by optic flow information. The presence of visual self-motion information may have reduced proprioceptive gain during learning. Thus, during overground walking, the learned proprioceptive split-belt pattern is more rapidly overridden by visual input due to its increased relative gain. The results suggest that when visual stimulation is provided during adaptive training, the system acquires the novel movement dynamics while maintaining the ability to flexibly adapt to different environments. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Spaceflight causes sensorimotor adaptations that result in balance deficiencies on return to a gravitational environment. Treadmill exercise within lower-body negative pressure (LBNP) helps protect physiological function during microgravity as simulated by bed rest. Therefore, we hypothesized that treadmill exercise within LBNP would prevent balance losses in both male and female identical twins during 30 days of 6° head-down tilt bed rest. Fifteen (seven female and eight male) identical twin sets participated in this simulation of microgravity. Within each twin pair, one twin was randomly assigned to an exercise group that performed 40 min of supine treadmill exercise within LBNP set to generate 1.0–1.2 body weight, followed by 5 min of static feet-supported LBNP, 6 days per week. Their identical sibling was assigned to a non-exercise control group with all other bed rest conditions equivalent. Before and immediately after bed rest, subjects completed standing and walking rail balance tests with eyes open and eyes closed. In control subjects, standing rail balance times (men: − 42%, women: − 40%), rail walk distances (men: − 44%, women: − 32%) and rail walk times (men: − 34%, women: − 31%) significantly decreased after bed rest. Compared with controls, treadmill exercise within LBNP significantly attenuated losses of standing rail balance time by 63% in men, but the 41% attenuation in women was not significant. Treadmill exercise within LBNP did not affect rail walk abilities in men or women. Treadmill exercise within LBNP during simulated spaceflight attenuates loss of balance control in men but not in women. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={The physiological regulation of skin temperature can be modulated not only by autonomic brain regions, but also by a network of higher-level cortical areas involved in the maintenance of a coherent representation of the body. In this study we assessed in healthy participants if the sensorimotor changes taking place during motor adaptation to the lateral displacement of the visual scene induced by wearing prismatic lenses (prism adaptation, PA), and the aftereffects, after prisms' removal, on the ability to process spatial coordinates, were associated with skin temperature regulation changes. We found a difference in thermoregulatory control as a function of the direction of the prism-induced displacement of the visual scene, and the subsequent sensorimotor adaptation. After PA to rightward displacing lenses, with leftward aftereffects (the same directional procedure efficaciously used for ameliorating left spatial neglect in right-brain-damaged patients) the hands' temperature decreased. Conversely, after adaptation to neutral lenses, and PA to leftward displacing lenses, with rightward aftereffects, the temperature of both hands increased. These results suggest a lateral asymmetry in the effects of PA on skin temperature regulation, and a relationship between body spatial representations and homeostatic control in humans. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Recent computational and behavioral studies suggest that motor adaptation results from the update of multiple memories with different timescales. Here, we designed a model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which subjects adapted to two opposing visuomotor rotations. A computational model of motor adaptation with multiple memories was fitted to the behavioral data to generate time-varying regressors of brain activity. We identified regional specificity to timescales: in particular, the activity in the inferior parietal region and in the anterior-medial cerebellum was associated with memories for intermediate and long timescales, respectively. A sparse singular value decomposition analysis of variability in specificities to timescales over the brain identified four components, two fast, one middle, and one slow, each associated with different brain networks. Finally, a multivariate decoding analysis showed that activity patterns in the anterior-medial cerebellum progressively represented the two rotations. Our results support the existence of brain regions associated with multiple timescales in adaptation and a role of the cerebellum in storing multiple internal models. © 2015 Kim et al.},

abstract={Humans are able to adapt their motor commands to make accurate movements in novel sensorimotor environments, such as when wielding tools that alter limb dynamics. However, it is unclear to what extent sensorimotor representations, obtained through experience with one limb, are available to the opposite, untrained limb and in which form they are available. Here, we compared crosslimb transfer of force-field compensation after participants adapted to a velocity-dependent curl field, oriented either in the sagittal or the transverse plane. Due to the mirror symmetry of the limbs, the force field had identical effects for both limbs in joint and extrinsic coordinates in the sagittal plane but conflicting jointbased effects in the transverse plane. The degree of force-field compensation exhibited by the opposite arm in probe trials immediately after initial learning was significantly greater after sagittal (26 ±5%) than transverse plane adaptation (9± 4%; P <.001), irrespective of whether participants learned initially with the left or the right arm or via abrupt or gradual exposure to the force field. Thus transfer was impaired when the orientation of imposed dynamics conflicted in intrinsic coordinates for the two limbs. The data reveal that neural representations of novel dynamics are only partially available to the opposite limb, since transfer is incomplete even when force-field perturbation is spatially compatible for the two limbs, according to both intrinsic and extrinsic coordinates. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Humans can remarkably adapt their motor behavior to novel environmental conditions, yet it remains unclear which factors enable us to transfer what we have learned with one limb to the other. Here we tested the hypothesis that interlimb transfer of sensorimotor adaptation is determined by environmental conditions but also by individual characteristics. We specifically examined the adaptation of unconstrained reaching movements to a novel Coriolis, velocity-dependent force field. Right-handed subjects sat at the center of a rotating platform and performed forward reaching movements with the upper limb toward flashed visual targets in prerotation, per-rotation (i.e., adaptation), and postrotation tests. Here only the dominant arm was used during adaptation and interlimb transfer was assessed by comparing performance of the nondominant arm before and after dominant-arm adaptation. Vision and no-vision conditions did not significantly influence interlimb transfer of trajectory adaptation, which on average was significant but limited. We uncovered a substantial heterogeneity of interlimb transfer across subjects and found that interlimb transfer can be qualitatively and quantitatively predicted for each healthy young individual. A classifier showed that in our study, interlimb transfer could be predicted based on the subject’s task performance, most notably motor variability during learning, and his or her laterality quotient. Positive correlations suggested that variability of motor performance and lateralization of arm movement control facilitate interlimb transfer. We further show that these individual characteristics can predict the presence and the magnitude of interlimb transfer of left-handers. Overall, this study suggests that individual characteristics shape the way the nervous system can generalize motor learning. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation has traditionally been viewed as a purely error-based process. There is, however, growing appreciation for the idea that performance changes in these tasks can arise from the interplay of error-based adaptation with other learning processes. The challenge is to specify constraints on these different processes, elucidating their respective contributions to performance, as well as the manner in which they interact. We address this question by exploring constraints on savings, the phenomenon in which people show faster performance gains when the same learning task is repeated. In a series of five experiments, we demonstrate that error-based learning associated with sensorimotor adaptation does not contribute to savings. Instead, savings reflects improvements in action selection, rather than motor execution. ©2015 the authors.},

abstract={Current theoretical models and empirical research suggest that sensorimotor control and feedback processes may guide time perception and production. In the current study, we investigated the role of motor control and auditory feedback in an interval-production task performed under heightened cognitive load. We hypothesized that general associative learning mechanisms enable the calibration of time against patterns of dynamic change in motor control processes and auditory feedback information. In Experiment 1, we applied a dual-task interference paradigm consisting of a finger-tapping (continuation) task in combination with a working memory task. Participants (nonmusicians) had to either perform or avoid arm movements between successive key presses (continuous vs. discrete). Auditory feedback from a key press (a piano tone) filled either the complete duration of the target interval or only a small part (long vs. short). Results suggested that both continuous movement control and long piano feedback tones contributed to regular timing production. In Experiment 2, we gradually adjusted the duration of the long auditory feedback tones throughout the duration of a trial. The results showed that a gradual shortening of tones throughout time increased the rate at which participants performed tone onsets. Overall, our findings suggest that the human perceptual-motor system may be important in guiding temporal behavior under cognitive load. © 2015 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Purpose: The risk of recurrent ankle sprains could be reduced if the ankle joint is positioned in a more closed pack position (eversion and dorsiflexion) with enhanced co-activation of Tibialis Anterior (TA) and Peroneus Longus (PL) around heel contact in walking. We examined whether such alteration can be induced by augmenting ankle position error in the inversion and plantarflexion directions. Methods: Fifteen young, healthy subjects participated in this study. They walked on a treadmill while a light weight was affixed to the dorsal–lateral side of the test foot to create afferent error signals in the inversion and plantarflexion directions. We recorded and analyzed subjects’ ankle kinematics and electromyographic (EMG) activity of TA and PL before (baseline), during (adaptation), and after (post adaptation) walking with the weight. Our analyses focused on 30 ms before and after heel contact where ankle sprains are most likely to occur. Results: Subjects increased ankle eversion before and after heel contact during the adaptation period. This increase carried over to the post adaptation period following removal of the weight. The weight also induced an increase in the TA activity before heel contact during late adaptation, although this increase did not carry over to the post adaptation period. No significant changes were observed in ankle dorsiflexion, PL activity, and muscle co-activation. Conclusion: Our error-driven approach is feasible to reduce ankle inversion around heel contact in walking, and may have clinical implication on intervention of recurrent ankle sprains. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Adapting to a novel sensorimotor condition is generally thought to result in the formation of an internal representation associated with the novel sensorimotor transform. While the presence of after-effects following sensorimotor adaptation is taken as evidence that such an internal representation was devel-oped as a result of adaptation, it remains unclear whether the absence of after-effects following sensorimotor adaptation indicates that no internal representation was developed. In the present study, we ex-amined this question by having individuals adapt to a 30° visual rotation with one arm first and testing 1) how the initial adaptation would influence subsequent performance with the other arm under the same visual condition (called direct-effects) or under a normal visual condition (called after-effects); or 2) how the initial adaptation that occurred at one workspace location would influence subsequent per-formance at another location with the same arm under the same or a normal visual condition. Results indicated that initial adaptation with one arm significantly influenced subsequent performance with the other in terms of direct-but not after-effects and that initial adaptation at one workspace location significantly influenced subsequent perfor-mance at a new location with the same arm in terms of both direct-and after-effects, but to different extents. These findings indicate that formation of a neural representation associated with a novel visuomotor transform does not always result in after-effects and suggest that visuomotor adaptation may involve multiple aspects of a neural representation, some of which are effector independent and some of which are effector dependent.

abstract={Previous studies on sensorimotor adaptation revealed no awareness of the nature of the perturbation after adaptation to an abrupt 30° rotation of visual feedback or after adaptation to gradually introduced perturbations. Whether the degree of awareness depends on the magnitude of the perturbation, though, has as yet not been tested. Instead of using questionnaires, as was often done in previous work, the present study used a process dissociation procedure to measure awareness and unawareness. A naïve, implicit group and a group of subjects using explicit strategies adapted to 20°, 40° and 60° cursor rotations in different adaptation blocks that were each followed by determination of awareness and unawareness indices. The awareness index differed between groups and increased from 20° to 60° adaptation. In contrast, there was no group difference for the unawareness index, but it also depended on the size of the rotation. Early adaptation varied between groups and correlated with awareness: The more awareness a participant had developed the more the person adapted in the beginning of the adaptation block. In addition, there was a significant group difference for savings but it did not correlate with awareness. Our findings suggest that awareness depends on perturbation size and that aware and strategic processes are differentially involved during adaptation and savings.

abstract={Sensing gravity is vital for our perception of spatial orientation, the control of upright posture, and generation of our everyday activities. When an astronaut transitions to microgravity or returns to earth, the vestibular input arising from self-motion will not match the brain's expectation. Our recent neurophysiological studies have provided insight into how the nervous system rapidly reorganizes when vestibular input becomes unreliable by both (1) updating its internal model of the sensory consequences of motion and (2) up-weighting more reliable extra-vestibular information. These neural strategies, in turn, are linked to improvements in sensorimotor performance (e.g., gaze and postural stability, locomotion, orienting) and perception characterized by similar time courses. We suggest that furthering our understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie sensorimotor adaptation will have important implications for optimizing training programs for astronauts before and after space exploration missions and for the design of goal-oriented rehabilitation for patients.},

abstract={The “Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V2Suit) for Space Habitation and Exploration” is a novel system concept that provides a platform for integrating sensors and actuators with daily astronaut intravehicular activities to improve health and performance, while reducing the mass and volume of the physiologic adaptation countermeasure systems, as well as the required exercise time during long-duration space exploration missions. The V2Suit system leverages wearable kinematic monitoring technology and uses inertial measurement units (IMUs) and control moment gyroscopes (CMGs) within miniaturized modules placed on body segments to provide a “viscous resistance” during movements against a specified direction of “down”—initially as a countermeasure to the sensorimotor adaptation performance decrements that manifest themselves while living and working in microgravity and during gravitational transitions during long-duration spaceflight, including post-flight recovery and rehabilitation. Several aspects of the V2Suit system concept were explored and simulated prior to developing a brassboard prototype for technology demonstration. This included a system architecture for identifying the key components and their interconnects, initial identification of key human-system integration challenges, development of a simulation architecture for CMG selection and parameter sizing, and the detailed mechanical design and fabrication of a module. The brassboard prototype demonstrates closed-loop control from “down” initialization through CMG actuation, and provides a research platform for human performance evaluations to mitigate sensorimotor adaptation, as well as a tool for determining the performance requirements when used as a musculoskeletal deconditioning countermeasure. This type of countermeasure system also has Earth benefits, particularly in gait or movement stabilization and rehabilitation. © 2015 Duda, Vasquez, Middleton, Hansberry, Newman, Jacobsand West.},

abstract={Different error signals can induce sensorimotor adaptation during visually guided reaching, possibly evoking different neural adaptation mechanisms. Here we investigate reach adaptation induced by visual target errors without perturbing the actual or sensed hand position. We analyzed the spatial generalization of adaptation to target error to compare it with other known generalization patterns and simulated our results with a neural network model trained to minimize target error independent of prediction errors. Subjects reached to different peripheral visual targets and had to adapt to a sudden fixed-amplitude displacement ("jump") consistently occurring for only one of the reach targets. Subjects simultaneously had to perform contralateral unperturbed saccades, which rendered the reach target jump unnoticeable. As a result, subjects adapted by gradually decreasing reach errors and showed negative aftereffects for the perturbed reach target. Reach errors generalized to unperturbed targets according to a translational rather than rotational generalization pattern, but locally, not globally. More importantly, reach errors generalized asymmetrically with a skewed generalization function in the direction of the target jump. Our neural network model reproduced the skewed generalization after adaptation to target jump without having been explicitly trained to produce a specific generalization pattern. Our combined psychophysical and simulation results suggest that target jump adaptation in reaching can be explained by gradual updating of spatial motor goal representations in sensorimotor association networks, independent of learning induced by a prediction-error about the hand position. The simulations make testable predictions about the underlying changes in the tuning of sensorimotor neurons during target jump adaptation. © 2015 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Humans perform vertical and horizontal arm motions with different temporal patterns. The specific velocity profiles are chosen by the central nervous system by integrating the gravitational force field to minimize energy expenditure. However, what happens when a visuomotor rotation is applied, so that a motion performed in the horizontal plane is perceived as vertical? We investigated the dynamic of the adaptation of the spatial and temporal properties of a pointing motion during prolonged exposure to a 90° visuomotor rotation, where a horizontal movement was associated with a vertical visual feedback. We found that participants immediately adapted the spatial parameters of motion to the conflicting visual scene in order to keep their arm trajectory straight. In contrast, the initial symmetric velocity profiles specific for a horizontal motion were progressively modified during the conflict exposure, becoming more asymmetric and similar to those appropriate for a vertical motion. Importantly, this visual effect that increased with repetitions was not followed by a consistent aftereffect when the conflicting visual feedback was absent (catch and washout trials). In a control experiment we demonstrated that an intrinsic representation of the temporal structure of perceived vertical motions could provide the error signal allowing for this progressive adaptation of motion timing. These findings suggest that gravity strongly constrains motor learning and the reweighting process between visual and proprioceptive sensory inputs, leading to the selection of a motor plan that is suboptimal in terms of energy expenditure. © 2015, American Physiological Society.

abstract={Neurologically healthy individuals use sensory feedback to alter future movements by updating internal models of the effector system and environment. For example, when visual feedback about limb movements or auditory feedback about speech movements is experimentally perturbed, the planning of subsequent movements is adjusted - i.e., sensorimotor adaptation occurs. A separate line of studies has demonstrated that experimentally delaying the sensory consequences of limb movements causes the sensory input to be attributed to external sources rather than to one's own actions. Yet similar feedback delays have remarkably little effect on visuo-motor adaptation (although the rate of learning varies, the amount of adaptation is only moderately affected with delays of 100-200. ms, and adaptation still occurs even with a delay as long as 5000. ms). Thus, limb motor learning remains largely intact even in conditions where error assignment favors external factors. Here, we show a fundamentally different result for sensorimotor control of speech articulation: auditory-motor adaptation to formant-shifted feedback is completely eliminated with delays of 100. ms or more. Thus, for speech motor learning, real-time auditory feedback is critical. This novel finding informs theoretical models of human motor control in general and speech motor control in particular, and it has direct implications for the application of motor learning principles in the habilitation and rehabilitation of individuals with various sensorimotor speech disorders. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Recent work has pointed to the advantages of using distorted reality to foster sensorimotor adaptations. Here we evaluate the extent to which a visuomotor discrepancy created within the large CAVE2 Hybrid Reality Environment might induce an adaptive effect in walking. This experiment specifically studied the consequences of exposure to a rotational gain that made it appear as though the subjects were turning more than actual by a ratio of 3 to 2. We then studied subjects' abilities make turns while blindfolded before and after the experience. This brief training period (~5 minutes) resulted in slightly larger turns. Such rapid adaptive responses can be interpreted as an alteration of the motor plan and possibly a recalibration of proprioceptive and vestibular senses caused by the alteration of visual input. This study provides preliminary evidence of the possibilities of using distorted reality to constructively enhance motor training and rehabilitation.},

abstract={In a recent study, Tan et al. (2014a,b) showed that the increase in β -power typically observed after a movement above sensorimotor regions (_-rebound) is attenuated when movement-execution errors are induced by visual perturbations. Moreover, akin to sensorimotor adaptation, the effect depended on the context in which the errors are experienced. Thus the β -rebound attenuation might relate to neural processes involved in trial-to-trial adaptive mechanisms. In two EEG experiments with human participants, along with the β -rebound, we examine β -activity during the preparation of reaches immediately following perturbed movements. In the first experiment, we show that both foreperiod and postmovement β -activities are parametrically modulated by the sizes of kinematic errors produced by unpredictable mechanical perturbations (force field) independent of their on-line corrections. In the second experiment, we contrast two types of reach errors: movement-execution errors that trigger trial-to-trial adaptive mechanisms and goal errors that do not elicit sensorimotor adaptation. Movement-execution errors were induced by mechanical or visual perturbations, whereas goal errors were caused by unexpected displacements of the target at movement initiation. Interestingly, foreperiod and postmovement β -activities exhibit contrasting patterns, pointing to important functional differences of their underlying neuronal activity. While both types of reach errors attenuate the postmovement β -rebound, only the kinematic errors that trigger trial-to-trial motor-command updates influenced β -activity during the foreperiod. These findings suggest that the error-related modulation of the β -rebound may reflect salience processing, independent of sensorimotor adaptation. In contrast, modulations in the foreperiod β -power might relate to the motorcommand adjustments activated after movement-execution errors are experienced. © 2015 the authors.},

abstract={Purpose. Using visual feedback to modify sensorimotor output in response to changes in the external environment is essential for daily function. Prism adaptation is a well-established experimental paradigm to quantify sensorimotor adaptation; that is, how the sensorimotor system adapts to an optically-altered visuospatial environment. Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by spatiotemporal deficits in vision that impacts manual and oculomotor function. This study explored the effects of anisometropic amblyopia on prism adaptation. Methods. Eight participants with anisometropic amblyopia and 11 visually-normal adults, all right-handed, were tested. Participants pointed to visual targets and were presented with feedback of hand position near the terminus of limb movement in three blocks: baseline, adaptation, and deadaptation. Adaptation was induced by viewing with binocular 11.4° (20 prism diopter [PD]) left-shifting prisms. All tasks were performed during binocular viewing. Results. Participants with anisometropic amblyopia required significantly more trials (i.e., increased time constant) to adapt to prismatic optical displacement than visually-normal controls. During the rapid error correction phase of adaptation, people with anisometropic amblyopia also exhibited greater variance in motor output than visually-normal controls. Conclusions. Amblyopia impacts on the ability to adapt the sensorimotor system to an optically-displaced visual environment. The increased time constant and greater variance in motor output during the rapid error correction phase of adaptation may indicate deficits in processing of visual information as a result of degraded spatiotemporal vision in amblyopia. © 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.},

abstract={The ability to predict the optimal fingertip forces according to object properties before the object is lifted is known as feed forward control, and it is thought to occur due to the formation of internal representations of the object’s properties. The control of fingertip forces to objects of different weights has been studied extensively by using a custom-made grip device instrumented with force sensors. Feed forward control is measured by the rate of change of the vertical (load) force before the object is lifted. However, the precise relationship between the rate of change of load force and object weight and how it varies across healthy individuals in a population is not clearly understood. Using sets of 10 different weights, we have shown that there is a log-linear relationship between the fingertip load force rates and weight among neurologically intact individuals. We found that after one practice lift, as the weight increased, the peak load force rate (PLFR) increased by a fixed percentage, and this proportionality was common among the healthy subjects. However, at any given weight, the level of PLFR varied across individuals and was related to the efficiency of the muscles involved in lifting the object, in this case the wrist and finger extensor muscles. These results quantify feed forward control during grasp and lift among healthy individuals and provide new benchmarks to interpret data from neurologically impaired populations as well as a means to assess the effect of interventions on restoration of feed forward control and its relationship to muscular control. © 2015 the American Physiological Society},

abstract={Human speech perception rapidly adapts to maintain comprehension under adverse listening conditions. For example, with exposure listeners can adapt to heavily accented speech produced by a non-native speaker. Outside the domain of speech perception, adaptive changes in sensory and motor processing have been attributed to cerebellar functions. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigates whether adaptation in speech perception also involves the cerebellum. Acoustic stimuli were distorted using a vocoding plus spectral-shift manipulation and presented in a word recognition task. Regions in the cerebellum that showed differences before versus after adaptation were identified, and the relationship between activity during adaptation and subsequent behavioral improvements was examined. These analyses implicated the right Crus I region of the cerebellum in adaptive changes in speech perception. A functional correlation analysis with the right Crus I as a seed region probed for cerebral cortical regions with covarying hemodynamic responses during the adaptation period. The results provided evidence of a functional network between the cerebellum and language-related regions in the temporal and parietal lobes of the cerebral cortex. Consistent with known cerebellar contributions to sensorimotor adaptation, cerebro-cerebellar interactions may support supervised learning mechanisms that rely on sensory prediction error signals in speech perception. © 2014 The Author 2014.

abstract={Previous studies have shown that performing a motor action toward a target decreases the perceptual asynchrony observed in a temporal order judgment (TOJ) of a change in the target’s visual attributes. We examined the temporal limit of this effect and whether this temporal limit can be extended through sensorimotor adaptation. Participants performed a TOJ task related to changes of the position and color of a visual stimulus in a perceptual and a motor task. A fixed change (color or position) occurred 250 or 500 ms following an auditory cue (perceptual task) or the end of a manual reaching action (motor task), whereas the variable change (position or color) occurred randomly within a time window of ±200 ms locked to the fixed change. The points of subjective simultaneity (PSSs) revealed that performing a voluntary action decreased the temporal asynchrony observed in the perceptual task, but only in the 250-ms delay condition. In Experiment 2, the fixed change occurred 1 s after either an auditory cue or the end of a manual reaching action, and the variable change occurred either simultaneously (new sensorimotor contingencies, 60 % of trials) or within a time window of ±200 ms (40 % of trials). The PSSs revealed that temporal asynchrony decreased in the motor task, but only after adaptation to the 1-s delay. Taken together, these data show that voluntary motor action affects the temporal binding of visual attributes for a period of less than 500 ms after the end of the action. Sensorimotor adaptation can nevertheless extend this time interval, at least up to 1 s. © 2014, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract={Accumulating evidence points to a role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of primary dystonia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the abnormalities of cerebellar motor learning in primary dystonia are solely detectable in more pure forms of cerebellum-dependent associative motor learning paradigms, or whether these are also present in other motor learning paradigms that rely heavily on the cerebellum but in addition require a more widespread sensorimotor network. Twenty-six patients with various forms of focal dystonia and 10 age-matched healthy controls participated in a motor learning paradigm on a split-belt treadmill. By using reflective markers, three-dimensional kinematics were recorded using a 6-camera motion analysis system. Adaptation walking parameters were analyzed offline, comparing the different dystonia groups and healthy controls. Patients with blepharospasm and writer’s cramp were significantly impaired on various adaptation walking parameters. Whereas results of cervical dystonia patients did not differ from healthy controls in terms of adaptation walking parameters, differences in parameters of normal gait were found. We have here demonstrated abnormal sensorimotor adaptation with the split-belt paradigm in patients with blepharospasm and writer’s cramp. This reinforces the current concept of cerebellar dysfunction in primary dystonia, and that this extends beyond more pure forms of cerebellum-dependent associative motor learning paradigms. However, the finding of normal adaptation in cervical dystonia patients indicates that the pattern of cerebellar dysfunction may be slightly different for the various forms of primary focal dystonia, suggesting that actual cerebellar pathology may not be a primary driving force in dystonia. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={We compared sensorimotor adaptation in the visual and the auditory modality. Subjects pointed to visual targets while receiving direct spatial information about fingertip position in the visual modality, or they pointed to visual targets while receiving indirect information about fingertip position in the visual modality, or they pointed to auditory targets while receiving indirect information about fingertip position in the auditory modality. Feedback was laterally shifted to induce adaptation, and aftereffects were tested with both target modalities and both hands. We found that aftereffects of adaptation were smaller when tested with the non-adapted hand, i.e., intermanual transfer was incomplete. Furthermore, aftereffects were smaller when tested in the non-adapted target modality, i.e., intermodal transfer was incomplete. Aftereffects were smaller following adaptation with indirect rather than direct feedback, but they were not smaller following adaptation with auditory rather than visual targets. From this we conclude that the magnitude of adaptive recalibration rather depends on the method of feedback delivery (indirect versus direct) than on the modality of feedback (visual versus auditory). © 2014 Schmitz, Bock.},

abstract={Humans can learn to make accurate movements when the required map between vision and motor commands changes, but can visuomotor maps obtained through experience with one limb benefit the other? Complete transfer would require new maps to be both fully compatible and accessible between limbs. However, when this question is addressed by providing subjects with rotated visual feedback during reaching, transfer is rarely apparent in the first few trials with the unpracticed limb and is sometimes absent altogether. Partial transfer might be explained by limited accessibility to remapped brain circuits, since critical visuomotor transformations mediating unilateral movements appear to be lateralized. Alternatively, if adaptation involves movement representations associated with both extrinsic (i.e., direction of motion in space) and intrinsic (i.e., joint or muscle based) frames of reference, new visuomotor maps might be incompatible with opposite limb use when visual distortions have opposite effects for the two limbs in intrinsic coordinates. Here we addressed this issue when subjects performed an isometric aiming task with the index finger. We manipulated the alignment of visuomotor distortion for the two hands in different reference frames by altering body posture relative to the orientation of the finger and the visual display. There was strong, immediate transfer of adaptation between limbs only when visuomotor distortion had identical effects in eye- and joint-based coordinates bilaterally. This implies that new visuomotor maps are encoded in neural circuits associated with both intrinsic and extrinsic movement representations and are available to both limbs. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={A combination of lexical bias and altered auditory feedback was used to investigate the influence of higher-order linguistic knowledge on the perceptual aspects of speech motor control. Subjects produced monosyllabic real words or pseudo-words containing the vowel [ε] (as in "head") under conditions of altered auditory feedback involving a decrease in vowel first formant (F1) frequency. This manipulation had the effect of making the vowel sound more similar to [I] (as in "hid"), affecting the lexical status of produced words in two Lexical-Change (LC) groups (either changing them from real words to pseudo-words: e.g., less-liss, or pseudo-words to real words: e.g., kess-kiss). Two Non-Lexical-Change (NLC) control groups underwent the same auditory feedback manipulation during the production of [ε] real- or pseudo-words, only without any resulting change in lexical status (real words to real words: e.g., mess-miss, or pseudo-words to pseudo-words: e.g., ness-niss). The results from the LC groups indicate that auditory-feedback-based speech motor learning is sensitive to the lexical status of the stimuli being produced, in that speakers tend to keep their acoustic speech outcomes within the auditory-perceptual space corresponding to the task-related side of the word/non-word boundary (real words or pseudo-words). For the NLC groups, however, no such effect of lexical status is observed. © 2014 Bourguignon, Baum and Shiller.},

abstract={Visuomotor adaptation has been thought to be an implicit process that results when a sensory-prediction error signal is used to update a forward model.Astriking feature of human competence is the ability to receive verbal instructions and employ strategies to solve tasks; such explicit processes could be used during visuomotor adaptation. Here, we used a novel task design that allowed us to obtain continuous verbal reports of aiming direction while participants learned a visuomotor rotation. We had two main hypotheses: the contribution of explicit learning would be modulated by instruction and the contribution of implicit learning would be modulated by the form of error feedback. By directly assaying aiming direction, we could identify the time course of the explicit component and, via subtraction, isolate the implicit component of learning. There were marked differences in the time courses of explicit and implicit contributions to learning. Explicit learning, driven by target error, was achieved by initially large then smaller explorations of aiming direction biased toward the correct solution. In contrast, implicit learning, driven by a sensory-prediction error, was slow and monotonic. Continuous error feedback reduced the amplitude of explicit learning and increased the contribution of implicit learning. The presence of instruction slightly increased the rate of initial learning and only had a subtle effect on implicit learning.Weconclude that visuomotor adaptation, even in the absence of instruction, results from the interplay between explicit learning driven by target error and implicit learning of a forward model driven by prediction error. © 2014 the authors.},

abstract={Individuals learn new skills at different rates. Given the involvement of corticostriatal pathways in some types of learning, variations in dopaminergic transmission may contribute to these individual differences. Genetic polymorphisms of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) genes partially determine cortical and striatal dopamine availability, respectively. Individuals who are homozygous for the COMT methionine (met) allele show reduced cortical COMT enzymatic activity, resulting in increased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex as opposed to individuals who are carriers of the valine (val) allele. DRD2 G-allele homozygotes benefit from a higher striatal dopamine level compared with T-allele carriers. We hypothesized that individuals who are homozygous for COMT met and DRD2 G alleles would show higher rates of motor learning. Seventy-two young healthy females (20 ± 1.9 yr) performed a sensorimotor adaptation task and a motor sequence learning task. A nonparametric mixed model ANOVA revealed that the COMT val-val group demonstrated poorer performance in the sequence learning task compared with the met-met group and showed a learning deficit in the visuomotor adaptation task compared with both met-met and val-met groups. The DRD2 TT group showed poorer performance in the sequence learning task compared with the GT group, but there was no difference between DRD2 genotype groups in adaptation rate. Although these results did not entirely come out as one might predict based on the known contribution of corticostriatal pathways to motor sequence learning, they support the role of genetic polymorphisms of COMT val158met (rs4680) and DRD2 G>T (rs 1076560) in explaining individual differences in motor performance and motor learning, dependent on task type. © 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Motor learning tasks are often classified into adaptation tasks, which involve the recalibration of an existing control policy (the mapping that determines both feedforward and feedback commands), and skill-learning tasks, requiring the acquisition of new control policies. We show here that this distinction also applies to two different visuomotor transformations during reaching in humans: Mirror-reversal (left-right reversal over a mid-sagittal axis) of visual feedback versus rotation of visual feedback around the movement origin. During mirror-reversal learning, correct movement initiation (feedforward commands) and online corrections (feedback responses) were only generated at longer latencies. The earliest responses were directed into a nonmirrored direction, even after two training sessions. In contrast, for visual rotation learning, no dependency of directional error on reaction time emerged, and fast feedback responses to visual displacements of the cursor were immediately adapted. These results suggest that the motor system acquires a new control policy for mirror reversal, which initially requires extra processing time, while it recalibrates an existing control policy for visual rotations, exploiting established fast computational processes. Importantly, memory for visual rotation decayed between sessions, whereas memory for mirror reversals showed offline gains, leading to better performance at the beginning of the second session than in the end of the first. With shifts in time-accuracy tradeoff and offline gains, mirror-reversal learning shares common features with other skill-learning tasks. We suggest that different neuronal mechanisms underlie the recalibration of an existing versus acquisition of a new control policy and that offline gains between sessions are a characteristic of latter. © 2014 the authors.},

abstract={The authors investigated the effects of cognitive representations of movement directions on sensorimotor adaptation performance. Adaptation performance was measured via a pointing experiment in which participants were provided with visual feedback that was distorted along the midsagittal plane (i.e., left-right reversal). Performance was analyzed relative to participants individual adaptation gains and 3 groups were subsequently defined (i.e., skilled, average, and poor adapters). The group separation was kept for the Cognitive Measurement of Represented Directions, which was used to analyze participants cognitive representation of movement directions. The results showed that skilled adapters, in contrast to poor adapters, possess a global representation of movement directions aligned to the cardinal axes. The cognitive representation structure hence supports the sensorimotor adaptation performance. © 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Recent studies of human speech motor learning suggest that learning is accompanied by changes in auditory perception. But what drives the perceptual change? Is it a consequence of changes in the motor system? Or is it a result of sensory inflow during learning? Here, subjects participated in a speech motor-learning task involving adaptation to altered auditory feedback and they were subsequently tested for perceptual change. In two separate experiments, involving two different auditory perceptual continua, we show that changes in the speech motor system that accompany learning drive changes in auditory speech perception. Specifically, we obtained changes in speech perception when adaptation to altered auditory feedback led to speech production that fell into the phonetic range of the speech perceptual tests. However, a similar change in perception was not observed when the auditory feedback that subjects' received during learning fell into the phonetic range of the perceptual tests. This indicates that the central motor outflow associated with vocal sensorimotor adaptation drives changes to the perceptual classification of speech sounds. © 2014 the authors.},

abstract={When tracing a template with mirror-reversed vision (or distorted vision), the sensory information arising from the movement does not match the expected sensory consequences. In such situations, participants have to learn a new visuomotor mapping in order to trace the template with an accuracy and speed approaching that observed when tracing with direct vision. There are several suggestions that such visuomotor learning requires lowering the gain of the proprioceptive inputs. Generally, subjects learn this task in a seated condition offering a stable postural platform. Adapting to the new visuomotor relationship in a standing condition could add complexity and even hinder sensorimotor adaptation because balance control and processing of additional information typically interfere with each other. To examine this possibility, older individuals and young adults (on average, 70 and 22 years of age, respectively) were assigned to groups that trained to trace a shape with mirror-reversed vision in a seated or a standing condition for two sessions. For a third session, the seated groups (young and elderly) transferred to the standing condition while the standing groups continued to perform the tracing task while standing. This procedure allowed comparing the tracing performance of all groups (with the same amount of practice) in a standing condition. The standing groups also did a fourth session in a seated condition. Results show that older participants initially exposed to the standing condition were much slower to trace the template than all other groups (including the older group that performed the tracing task while seated). This slowness did not result from a baseline general slowness but from a genuine interference between balance control and the visuomotor conflict resulting from tracing the pattern with mirror-reversed vision. Besides, the Standing-Old participants that transferred to a seated condition in the fourth session immediately improved their tracing by reducing the total displacement covered by the pen to trace the template. Interestingly, the results did not support a transfer-appropriate practice hypothesis which suggests that training in a standing condition (at the third session) should have benefited the performance of those individuals who initially learned to trace the mirror pattern in a standing condition. This has important clinical implications: training at adapting to new sensory contexts or environmental conditions in conditions that do not challenge balance control could be necessary if one desires to attenuate the detrimental consequences on the postural or motor performances brought up by the interference between maintaining balance and the sensory reweighing processes. © 2013 American Aging Association.},

abstract={This study aimed at scrutinizing the neural correlates of sensorimotor adaptation. Subjects were exposed either to a gradually (group G) or to a suddenly introduced perturbation (group S) followed by a test of aftereffects. They were also exposed to a control condition equated for their movement errors during the adaptation condition. We registered subjects' brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Behavioral data revealed no difference between aftereffects in G and S, while imaging data suggest different neural correlates. Direct comparison between groups showed more adaptation-related activation in left cingulate and inferior frontal as well as right caudate and temporal areas in S than in G. In contrast, no neural activity was related more to G than to S and no common activations were found for both groups. Within-group analyses further revealed right inferior parietal lobe, cerebellar and cingulate cortex activity in group S and activation of frontal lobe and left cerebellum in group G for a contrast between adaptation condition and baseline. Less brain activity was observed when controlled for movement errors: the contrast between adaptation and control condition yielded left occipital lobe activity in group S, and left posterior dentate nucleus and brainstem activity in group G. The present data confirm an involvement of the cerebellar cortex in error processing during sudden adaptation, since this activation was found for the contrast 'adaptation-baseline' but not for 'adaptation-control.' In addition, our data suggest an involvement of deep cerebellar nuclei in the adaptation to gradually introduced distortions. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={When a perturbation is applied in a sensorimotor transformation task, subjects can adapt and maintain performance by either relying on sensory feedback, or, in the absence of such feedback, on information provided by rewards. For example, in a classical rotation task where movement endpoints must be rotated to reach a fixed target, human subjects can successfully adapt their reaching movements solely on the basis of binary rewards, although this proves much more difficult than with visual feedback. Here, we investigate such a reward-driven sensorimotor adaptation process in a minimal computational model of the task. The key assumption of the model is that synaptic plasticity is gated by the reward. We study how the learning dynamics depend on the target size, the movement variability, the rotation angle and the number of targets. We show that when the movement is perturbed for multiple targets, the adaptation process for the different targets can interfere destructively or constructively depending on the similarities between the sensory stimuli (the targets) and the overlap in their neuronal representations. Destructive interferences can result in a drastic slowdown of the adaptation. As a result of interference, the time to adapt varies non-linearly with the number of targets. Our analysis shows that these interferences are weaker if the reward varies smoothly with the subject's performance instead of being binary. We demonstrate how shaping the reward or shaping the task can accelerate the adaptation dramatically by reducing the destructive interferences. We argue that experimentally investigating the dynamics of reward-driven sensorimotor adaptation for more than one sensory stimulus can shed light on the underlying learning rules. © 2014 Darshan et al.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation ensures movement accuracy despite continuously changing environment and body. Adaptation of saccadic eye movements is a classical model of sensorimotor adaptation. Beside the well-established role of the brainstem-cerebellum in the adaptation of reactive saccades (RSs), the cerebral cortex has been suggested to be involved in the adaptation of voluntary saccades (VSs). Here, we provide direct evidence for a causal involvement of the parietal cortex in saccadic adaptation. First, the posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS) was identified in each subject using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Then, a saccadic adaptation paradigm was used to progressively reduce the amplitude of RSs and VSs, while single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) was applied over the right pIPS. The perturbations of pIPS resulted in impairment for the adaptation of VSs, selectively when spTMS was applied 60 ms after saccade onset. In contrast, the adaptation of RSs was facilitated by spTMS applied 90 ms after saccade initiation. The differential effect of spTMS relative to saccade types suggests a direct interference with pIPS activity for the VS adaptation and a remote interference with brainstem- cerebellum activity for the RS adaptation. These results support the hypothesis that the adaptation of VSs and RSs involves different neuronal substrates. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Long duration spaceflight (i.e., 22 days or longer) has been associated with changes in sensorimotor systems, resulting in difficulties that astronauts experience with posture control, locomotion, and manual control. The microgravity environment is an important causal factor for spaceflight induced sensorimotor changes. Whether spaceflight also affects other central nervous system functions such as cognition is yet largely unknown, but of importance in consideration of the health and performance of crewmembers both in- and post-flight. We are therefore conducting a controlled prospective longitudinal study to investigate the effects of spaceflight on the extent, longevity and neural bases of sensorimotor and cognitive performance changes. Here we present the protocol of our study. Methods/design: This study includes three groups (astronauts, bed rest subjects, ground-based control subjects) for which each the design is single group with repeated measures. The effects of spaceflight on the brain will be investigated in astronauts who will be assessed at two time points pre-, at three time points during-, and at four time points following a spaceflight mission of six months. To parse out the effect of microgravity from the overall effects of spaceflight, we investigate the effects of seventy days head-down tilted bed rest. Bed rest subjects will be assessed at two time points before-, two time points during-, and three time points post-bed rest. A third group of ground based controls will be measured at four time points to assess reliability of our measures over time. For all participants and at all time points, except in flight, measures of neurocognitive performance, fine motor control, gait, balance, structural MRI (T1, DTI), task fMRI, and functional connectivity MRI will be obtained. In flight, astronauts will complete some of the tasks that they complete pre- and post flight, including tasks measuring spatial working memory, sensorimotor adaptation, and fine motor performance. Potential changes over time and associations between cognition, motor-behavior, and brain structure and function will be analyzed.Discussion: This study explores how spaceflight induced brain changes impact functional performance. This understanding could aid in the design of targeted countermeasures to mitigate the negative effects of long-duration spaceflight. © 2013 Koppelmans et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Reach-to-grasp movements require information about the distance and size of target objects. Calibration of this information could be achieved via feedback information (visual and/or haptic) regarding terminal accuracy when target objects are grasped. A number of reports suggest that the nervous system alters reach-to-grasp behavior following either a visual or haptic error signal indicating inaccurate reaching. Nevertheless, the reported modification is generally partial (reaching is changed less than predicted by the feedback error), a finding that has been ascribed to slow adaptation rates. It is possible, however, that the modified reaching reflects the system's weighting of the visual and haptic information in the presence of noise rather than calibration per se. We modeled the dynamics of calibration and showed that the discrepancy between reaching behavior and the feedback error results from an incomplete calibration process. Our results provide evidence for calibration being an intrinsic feature of reach-to-grasp behavior. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={The present study reviewed the modular approach in adaptive motor control by taking cognitive efficiency into account. Three experiments were conducted to compare different visuomotor learning mechanisms (modular adaptation, use-dependent plasticity, and spatial realignment) in response to visuomotor rotations. During exposure, the visual feedback of flicking movements in a single-target scenario was rotated either 30° clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) at the left and right starting locations, respectively. Exposure to the CW and CCW rotations was carried out in an alternating order. After adaptation to the rotations, generalization was evaluated by assessing aftereffects from a set of untrained starting locations to the target (Experiments 1 and 2) or from the trained starting locations to a set of new targets (Experiment 3). Predictions made based on the different visuomotor learning mechanisms were compared to the empirical data. In spite of evidential advantages of modular structure, the current work could show a particular case of visuomotor transformation, in which modularity lacks efficiency. Results indicate that the adaptive motor control system employed the spatial realignment to accomplish adaptation more efficiently. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Motor learning often involves situations in which the somatosensory targets of movement are, at least initially, poorly defined, as for example, in learning to speak or learning the feel of a proper tennis serve. Under these conditions, motor skill acquisition presumably requires perceptual as well as motor learning. That is, it engages both the progressive shaping of sensory targets and associated changes in motor performance. In the present study, we test the idea that perceptual learning alters somatosensory function and in so doing produces changes to human motor performance and sensorimotor adaptation. Subjects in these experiments undergo perceptual training in which a robotic device passively moves the subject's arm on one of a set of fan-shaped trajectories. Subjects are required to indicate whether the robot moved the limb to the right or the left and feedback is provided. Over the course of training both the perceptual boundary and acuity are altered. The perceptual learning is observed to improve both the rate and extent of learning in a subsequent sensorimotor adaptation task and the benefits persist for at least 24 h. The improvement in the present studies varies systematically with changes in perceptual acuity and is obtained regardless of whether the perceptual boundary shift serves to systematically increase or decrease error on subsequent movements. The beneficial effects of perceptual training are found to be substantially dependent on reinforced decision-making in the sensory domain. Passive-movement training on its own is less able to alter subsequent learning in the motor system. Overall, this study suggests perceptual learning plays an integral role in motor learning. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={The cerebellum is critically involved in the adaptation mechanisms that maintain the accuracy of goal-directed acts such as saccadic eye movements. Two categories of saccades, each relying on different adaptation mechanisms, are defined: reactive (externally triggered) saccades and voluntary (internally triggered) saccades. The contribution of the medio-posterior part of the cerebellum to reactive saccades adaptation has been clearly demonstrated, but the evidence that other parts of the cerebellum are also involved is limited. Moreover, the cerebellar substrates of voluntary saccades adaptation have only been marginally investigated. Here, we addressed these two questions by investigating the adaptive capabilities of patients with cerebellar or pre-cerebellar stroke. We recruited three groups of patients presenting focal lesions located, respectively, in the supero-anterior cerebellum, the infero-posterior cerebellum and the lateral medulla (leading to a Wallenberg syndrome including motor dysfunctions similar to those resulting from lesion of the medio-posterior cerebellum). Adaptations of reactive saccades and of voluntary saccades were tested during separate sessions in all patients and in a group of healthy participants. The functional lesion of the medio-posterior cerebellum in Wallenberg syndrome strongly impaired the adaptation of both reactive and voluntary saccades. In contrast, patients with lesion in the supero-anterior part of the cerebellum presented a specific adaptation deficit of voluntary saccades. Finally, patients with an infero-posterior cerebellar lesion showed mild adaptation deficits. We conclude that the medio-posterior cerebellum is critical for the adaptation of both saccade categories, whereas the supero-anterior cerebellum is specifically involved in the adaptation of voluntary saccades. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Patients with hemispatial neglect ('neglect') following a brain lesion show difficulty responding or orienting to objects and events on the left side of space. Substantial evidence supports the use of a sensorimotor training technique called prism adaptation as a treatment for neglect. Reaching for visual targets viewed through prismatic lenses that induce a rightward shift in the visual image results in a leftward recalibration of reaching movements that is accompanied by a reduction of symptoms in patients with neglect. The understanding of prism adaptation has also been advanced through studies of healthy participants, in whom adaptation to leftward prismatic shifts results in temporary neglect-like performance. Interestingly, prism adaptation can also alter aspects of non-lateralised spatial attention. We previously demonstrated that prism adaptation alters the extent to which neglect patients and healthy participants process local features versus global configurations of visual stimuli. Since deficits in non-lateralised spatial attention are thought to contribute to the severity of neglect symptoms, it is possible that the effect of prism adaptation on these deficits contributes to its efficacy. This study examines the pervasiveness of the effects of prism adaptation on perception by examining the effect of prism adaptation on configural face processing using a composite face task. The composite face task is a persuasive demonstration of the automatic global-level processing of faces: the top and bottom halves of two familiar faces form a seemingly new, unknown face when viewed together. Participants identified the top or bottom halves of composite faces before and after prism adaptation. Sensorimotor adaptation was confirmed by significant pointing aftereffect, however there was no significant change in the extent to which the irrelevant face half interfered with processing. The results support the proposal that the therapeutic effects of prism adaptation are limited to dorsal stream processing. © 2013 Bultitude JH et al.},

abstract={The basal ganglia are involved in establishing motor plans for a wide range of behaviors. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a manifestation of basal ganglia dysfunction associated with a deficit in sensorimotor integration and difficulty in acquiring new motor sequences, thereby affecting motor learning. Previous studies of sensorimotor integration and sensorimotor adaptation in PD have focused on limb movements using visual and force-field alterations. Here, we report the results from a sensorimotor adaptation experiment investigating the ability of PD patients to make speech motor adjustments to a constant and predictable auditory feedback manipulation. Participants produced speech while their auditory feedback was altered and maintained in a manner consistent with a change in tongue position. The degree of adaptation was associated with the severity of motor symptoms. The patients with PD exhibited adaptation to the induced sensory error; however, the degree of adaptation was reduced compared with healthy, age-matched control participants. The reduced capacity to adapt to a change in auditory feedback is consistent with reduced gain in the sensorimotor system for speech and with previous studies demonstrating limitations in the adaptation of limb movements after changes in visual feedback among patients with PD. © 2013 Movement Disorder Society.},

abstract={While sensorimotor adaptation to prisms that displace the visual field takes minutes, adapting to an inversion of the visual field takes weeks. In spite of a long history of the study, the basis of this profound difference remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the computational issue that underpins this phenomenon and presents experiments designed to explore the mechanisms involved. We show that displacements can be mastered without altering the updated rule used to adjust the motor commands. In contrast, inversions flip the sign of crucial variables called sensitivity derivatives - variables that capture how changes in motor commands affect task error and therefore require an update of the feedback learning rule itself. Models of sensorimotor learning that assume internal estimates of these variables are known and fixed predicted that when the sign of a sensitivity derivative is flipped, adaptations should become increasingly counterproductive. In contrast, models that relearn these derivatives predict that performance should initially worsen, but then improve smoothly and remain stable once the estimate of the new sensitivity derivative has been corrected. Here, we evaluated these predictions by looking at human performance on a set of pointing tasks with vision perturbed by displacing and inverting prisms. Our experimental data corroborate the classic observation that subjects reduce their motor errors under inverted vision. Subjects' accuracy initially worsened and then improved. However, improvement was jagged rather than smooth and performance remained unstable even after 8 days of continually inverted vision, suggesting that subjects improve via an unknown mechanism, perhaps a combination of cognitive and implicit strategies. These results offer a new perspective on classic work with inverted vision. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The cerebellum is thought to mediate sensorimotor adaptation through the acquisition of internal models of the body-environment interaction. These representations can be of two types, identified as forward and inverse models. The first predicts the sensory consequences of actions, while the second provides the correct commands to achieve desired state transitions. In this paper, we propose a composite architecture consisting of multiple cerebellar internal models to account for the adaptation performance of humans during sensorimotor learning. The proposed model takes inspiration from the cerebellar microcomplex circuit, and employs spiking neurons to process information. We investigate the intrinsic properties of the cerebellar circuitry subserving efficient adaptation properties, and we assess the complementary contributions of internal representations by simulating our model in a procedural adaptation task. Our simulation results suggest that the coupling of internal models enhances learning performance significantly (compared with independent forward and inverse models), and it allows for the reproduction of human adaptation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide a computational explanation for the performance improvement observed after one night of sleep in a wide range of sensorimotor tasks. We predict that internal model coupling is a necessary condition for the offine consolidation of procedural memories. © 2013 Passot, Luque and Arleo.},

abstract={Motor learning is reflected in changes to the brain's functional organization as a result of experience. We show here that these changes are not limited to motor areas of the brain and indeed that motor learning also changes sensory systems. We test for plasticity in sensory systems using somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). A robotic device is used to elicit somatosensory inputs by displacing the arm in the direction of applied force during learning. We observe that following learning there are short latency changes to the response in somatosensory areas of the brain that are reliably correlated with the magnitude of motor learning: subjects who learn more show greater changes in SEP magnitude. The effects we observe are tied to motor learning. When the limb is displaced passively, such that subjects experience similar movements but without experiencing learning, no changes in the evoked response are observed. Sensorimotor adaptation thus alters the neural coding of somatosensory stimuli. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Background: Locomotor instability may affect planetary extravehicular activities during the initial adaptation to the new gravitational environment. The goal of this study was to quantify the locomotor, cognitive, and metabolic effects of exposure to a discordant sensory environment. Methods: A treadmill mounted on a 6-degree-of-freedom motion base was used to present 15 healthy subjects with a destabilizing support surface while they walked. Dependent measures of locomotor stability, cognitive load, and metabolic cost were stride frequency (SF), reaction time (RT), and the volume of oxygen consumed ( VO2 ), respectively. Subjects completed an 8-min baseline walk followed by 20 min of walking with a continuous, sinusoidal, laterally oscillating support-surface perturbation. Data for minutes 1, 7, 13, and 20 of the support-surface perturbation period were compared with the baseline. Results: SF, RT, and.V O 2 were significantly greater during support-surface motion than during the baseline walking condition and showed a trend toward recovery to baseline levels during the perturbation period. Results demonstrated that adaptation to walking in a discordant sensory environment has quantifiable and significant costs in SF, RT, and.V O 2 as shown by mean increases of 9%, 20%, and 4%, respectively, collected during the first minute of exposure. By the fourth minute of exposure, mean VO2 consumption had increased to 20% over its baseline. Discussion: We believe that preflight sensorimotor adaptation training paradigms will impart gains in stability and the ability to multitask, and might increase productive mission time by extending work time in extravehicular activity suits where metabolic expenditure is a limiting factor. ©by the Aerospace Medical Association,Alexandria, VA.},

abstract={Aim: Equilibrium-perturbing forces associated with a voluntary upper-limb movement can be strong enough to displace the whole-body centre of mass. In this condition, anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), developing in muscles other than the prime mover, are essential in maintaining the whole-body balance. Here, we test the hypothesis that APAs preceding an upper-limb target-reaching movement could play a role also in controlling the movement accuracy. Methods: Standing subjects (10) were asked to flex the right shoulder and touch with the index fingertip the centre of a target positioned in front of them. The reaching task was also performed while wearing and after doffing prismatic lenses (shifting the eye field rightward). EMGs from different upper- and lower-limb muscles and the mechanical actions to the ground were recorded. Results: (i) Before wearing prisms, subjects were very accurate in hitting the target, and the pointing movements were accompanied by APAs in quadriceps (Q) and tibialis anterior (TA) of both sides, and in right hamstrings (H) and soleus (SOL). (ii) After donning prisms, rightward pointing errors occurred, associated with a significant APA increase in right Q and TA, but without changes in the recruitment of right anterior deltoid (prime mover) and biceps brachii. (iii) These pointing errors were progressively compensated in about 10 trials, indicating a sensorimotor adaptation, and APAs returned to values recorded before wearing prisms. (iv) After doffing prisms, pointing errors occurred in the opposite direction but changes in APAs did not reach significance. Conclusion: We propose that, besides preserving the whole-body balance, APAs are also tailored to obtain an accurate voluntary movement. © 2013 Scandinavian Physiological Society.},

abstract={For some types of visuo-motor transformations like large visuo-motor rotations or the complex transformation of a sliding first-order lever, distinct adaptive processes have been hypothesized that produce a rapid, discrete approximation of the transformation and a slow, graded fine tuning, respectively. Here we investigate whether part-task training of only the second of these processes, namely the fine tuning, transfers to the subsequent performance in a condition with the full transformation of the sliding first-order lever. Therefore, we compared performance of three groups with different practice conditions during transfer to the full transformation. While two groups only practiced the fine tuning without the right-left inversion of the lever prior to transfer, a third group practiced the full lever transformation. Our results show a positive, but less than perfect transfer of the isolated practice of the fine tuning on performance with the full transformation. For the fine tuning itself, transfer was not reliably different from being perfect. The observation that the fine tuning can be acquired separately and added to the later adaptation to the left-right inversion of the lever supports the notion that these slow and fast processes progress rather independently. The additional finding that the preceding acquisition of the fine tuning also facilitates the subsequent rapid process could be due to generalized learning-to-learn or to a more precise assignment of movement errors to the process from which they originate. © 2013 Sülzenbrück, Heuer.},

abstract={The prediction of our actions and their interaction with the external environment is critical for sensorimotor adaptation. For instance, during prism exposure, which deviates laterally our visual field, we progressively correct movement errors by combining sensory feedback with forward model sensory predictions. However, very often we project our actions to the external environment without physically interacting with it (e.g., mental actions). An intriguing question is whether adaptation will occur if we imagine, instead of executing, an arm movement while wearing prisms. Here, we investigated prism adaptation during mental actions. In the first experiment, participants (n=54) performed arm pointing movements before and after exposure to the optical device. They were equally divided into six groups according to prism exposure: Prisms-Active, Prisms-Imagery, Prisms-Stationary, Prisms-Stationary-Attention, No Conflict-Prisms-Imagery, No Prisms-Imagery. Adaptation, measured by the difference in pointing errors between pre-test and post-test, occurred only in Prisms-Active and Prisms-Imagery conditions. The second experiment confirmed the results of the first experiment and further showed that sensorimotor adaptation was mainly due to proprioceptive realignment in both Prisms-Active (n=10) and Prisms-Imagery (n=10) groups. In both experiments adaptation was greater following actual than imagined pointing movements. The present results are the first demonstration of prism adaptation by mental practice under prism exposure and they are discussed in terms of internal forward models and sensorimotor plasticity. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The goal of this study was to determine if exposure to sensorimotor adaptation training improved head stabilization in older adults. Sixteen participants, age 66-81 yr, were assigned at random to the control group (n = 8) or the experimental group (n = 8). Both groups first completed 6 trials of walking a foam pathway consisting of a moveable platform that induced a lateral perturbation during walking. Head-in-space and trunk-in-space angular velocities were collected. Participants from both groups then trained twice per week for 4 wk. Both groups walked on a treadmill for 20 min. The control group viewed a static scene. The experimental group viewed a rotating visual scene that provided a perceptual-motor mismatch. After training, both groups were retested on the perturbation pathway test. The experimental group used a movement strategy that preserved head stabilization compared with the controls (p < .05). This training effect was not retained after 4 wk. © 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

abstract={A large body of evidence points to a role of basal ganglia dysfunction in the pathophysiology of dystonia, but recent studies indicate that cerebellar dysfunction may also be involved. The cerebellum influences sensorimotor adaptation by modulating sensorimotor plasticity of the primary motor cortex. Motor cortex sensorimotor plasticity is maladaptive in patients with writer's cramp. Here we examined whether putative cerebellar dysfunction in dystonia is linked to these patients' maladaptive plasticity. To that end we compared the performances of patients and healthy control subjects in a reaching task involving a visuomotor conflict generated by imposing a random deviation (-40° to 40°) on the direction of movement of the mouse/cursor. Such a task is known to involve the cerebellum. We also compared, between patients and healthy control subjects, how the cerebellum modulates the extent and duration of an ongoing sensorimotor plasticity in the motor cortex. The cerebellar cortex was excited or inhibited by means of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation before artificial sensorimotor plasticity was induced in the motor cortex by paired associative stimulation. Patients with writer's cramp were slower than the healthy control subjects to reach the target and, after having repeatedly adapted their trajectories to the deviations, they were less efficient than the healthy control subjects to perform reaching movement without imposed deviation. It was interpreted as impaired washing-out abilities. In healthy subjects, cerebellar cortex excitation prevented the paired associative stimulation to induce a sensorimotor plasticity in the primary motor cortex, whereas cerebellar cortex inhibition led the paired associative stimulation to be more efficient in inducing the plasticity. In patients with writer's cramp, cerebellar cortex excitation and inhibition were both ineffective in modulating sensorimotor plasticity. In patients with writer's cramp, but not in healthy subjects, behavioural parameters reflecting their capacity for adapting to the rotation and for washing-out of an earlier adaptation predicted the efficacy of inhibitory cerebellar conditioning to influence sensorimotor plasticity: the better the online adaptation, the smaller the influence of cerebellar inhibitory stimulation on motor cortex plasticity. Altered cerebellar encoding of incoming afferent volleys may result in decoupling the motor component from the afferent information flow, and also in maladjusted sensorimotor calibration. The loss of cerebellar control over sensorimotor plasticity might also lead to building up an incorrect motor program to specific adaptation tasks such as writing. © 2013 The Author (2013).},

abstract={Auditory feedback is important for accurate control of voice fundamental frequency (F(0)). The purpose of this study was to address whether task instructions could influence the compensatory responding and sensorimotor adaptation that has been previously found when participants are presented with a series of frequency-altered feedback (FAF) trials. Trained singers and musically untrained participants (nonsingers) were informed that their auditory feedback would be manipulated in pitch while they sang the target vowel [/α /]. Participants were instructed to either 'compensate' for, or 'ignore' the changes in auditory feedback. Whole utterance auditory feedback manipulations were either gradually presented ('ramp') in -2 cent increments down to -100 cents (1 semitone) or were suddenly ('constant') shifted down by 1 semitone. Results indicated that singers and nonsingers could not suppress their compensatory responses to FAF, nor could they reduce the sensorimotor adaptation observed during both the ramp and constant FAF trials. Compared to previous research, these data suggest that musical training is effective in suppressing compensatory responses only when FAF occurs after vocal onset (500-2500 ms). Moreover, our data suggest that compensation and adaptation are automatic and are influenced little by conscious control.},

abstract={Visuomotor adaptation of hand movements has been studied with two paradigms: double-step targets and distorted visual feedback. Here we investigate whether both procedures are based on a common adaptive mechanism. Subjects adapted either to double-step targets or to distorted feedback, each requiring a change of response angle by -15°. The magnitude of adaptation was larger with rotated feedback but magnitude of aftereffects was comparable, suggesting that the difference was due to strategic effects rather than visuomotor recalibration. Most importantly, subjects who adapted to double-step targets and were then exposed to rotated feedback performed as well as subjects who had fully adapted to rotated feedback, i.e., there was nearly 100% transfer from double-steps to rotations; likewise, the transfer from rotations to double-steps was almost 100%. From this we conclude that both types of adaptation share a common mechanism for recalibration. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Human motor behaviour is continually modified on the basis of errors between desired and actual movement outcomes. It is emerging that the role played by the primary motor cortex (M1) in this process is contingent upon a variety of factors, including the nature of the task being performed, and the stage of learning. Here we used repetitive TMS to test the hypothesis that M1 is intimately involved in the initial phase of sensorimotor adaptation. Inhibitory theta burst stimulation was applied to M1 prior to a task requiring modification of torques generated about the elbow/forearm complex in response to rotations of a visual feedback display. Participants were first exposed to a 30° clockwise (CW) rotation (Block A), then a 60° counterclockwise rotation (Block B), followed immediately by a second block of 30° CW rotation (A2). In the STIM condition, participants received 20. s of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) prior to the initial A Block. In the conventional (CON) condition, no stimulation was applied. The overt characteristics of performance in the two conditions were essentially equivalent with respect to the errors exhibited upon exposure to a new variant of the task. There were however, profound differences between the conditions in the latency of response preparation, and the excitability of corticospinal projections from M1, which accompanied phases of de-adaptation and re-adaptation (during Blocks B and A2). Upon subsequent exposure to the A rotation 24. h later, the rate of re-adaptation was lower in the stimulation condition than that present in the conventional condition. These results support the assertion that primary motor cortex assumes a key role in a network that mediates adaptation to visuomotor perturbation, and emphasise that it is engaged functionally during the early phase of learning. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The human sensorimotor system can concurrently adapt to two different distortions without interference when the distortions are cued by different contexts. We investigated whether this holds with four distortions as well. Subjects were exposed to an interlaced sequence of +30°, -30°, +60°, and -60° visuomotor rotations as the adaptation phase, cued by combinations of workspace location and by the arm used. Adaptation phase was followed by two episodes in each condition without any distortion testing the aftereffects. Results showed that the error at the onset of adaptation gradually decreased during adaptation to all four distortions without any sign of interference between the conditions. Furthermore, aftereffects of adaptation to ±30° rotation were significantly greater than of adaptation to ±60° rotation. We conclude that the human sensorimotor system is able to concurrently adapt to four different visual distortions when they are cued by different contexts. However, the results of aftereffects are ambiguous: Recalibration could be based on at least four parallel modules. © 2012 The Author(s).},

abstract={Potentially dangerous events in the environment evoke automatic ocular responses, called reactive saccades. Adaptation processes, which maintain saccade accuracy against various events (e.g. growth, aging, neuro-muscular lesions), are to date mostly relayed to cerebellar activity. Here we demonstrate that adaptation of reactive saccades also involves cerebral cortical areas. Moreover, we provide the first identification of the neural substrates of adaptation of voluntary saccades, representing the complement to reactive saccades for the active exploration of our environment. An fMRI approach was designed to isolate adaptation from saccade production: an adaptation condition in which the visual target stepped backward 50. ms after saccade termination was compared to a control condition where the same target backstep occurred 500. ms after saccade termination. Subjects were tested for reactive and voluntary saccades in separate sessions. Multi-voxel pattern analyses of fMRI data from previously-defined regions of interests (ROIs) significantly discriminated between adaptation and control conditions for several ROIs. Some of these areas were revealed for adaptation of both saccade categories (cerebellum, frontal cortex), whereas others were specifically related to reactive saccades (temporo-parietal junction, hMT. +/V5) or to voluntary saccades (medial and posterior areas of intra-parietal sulcus). These findings critically extend our knowledge on brain motor plasticity by showing that saccadic adaptation relies on a hitherto unknown contribution of the cerebral cortex. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Quantitative descriptions of the process of recovery of motor functions in impaired subjects during robot-assisted exercise might help to understand how to use these devices to make recovery faster and more effective. Linear dynamical models have been used to describe the dynamics of sensorimotor adaptation. Here, we extend this formalism to characterize the neuromotor recovery process. We focus on a robot therapy experiment that involved chronic stroke survivors, based on a robot-assisted arm extension task. The results suggest that modeling the recovery process with dynamical models is feasible, and could allow predicting the long-term outcome of a robot-assisted rehabilitation treatment. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We have recently demonstrated that visuospatial working memory performance predicts the rate of motor skill learning, particularly during the early phase of visuomotor adaptation. Here, we follow up these correlational findings with direct manipulations of working memory resources to determine the impact on visuomotor adaptation, a form of motor learning. We conducted two separate experiments. In the first one, we used a resource depletion strategy to investigate whether the rate of early visuomotor adaptation would be negatively affected by fatigue of spatial working memory resources. In the second study, we employed a dual n-back task training paradigm that has been shown to result in transfer effects [1] over five weeks to determine whether training-related improvements would boost the rate of early visuomotor adaptation. The depletion of spatial working memory resources negatively affected the rate of early visuomotor adaptation. However, enhancing working memory capacity via training did not lead to improved rates of visuomotor adaptation, suggesting that working memory capacity may not be the factor limiting maximal rate of visuomotor adaptation in young adults. These findings are discussed from a resource limitation/capacity framework with respect to current views of motor learning. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation to rotated visual feedback is thought to be achieved by directionally tuned modules. Here we scrutinize whether adaptation to reversed vision utilizes similar mechanisms. Specifically, we hypothesize that adaptive transfer to unpracticed target directions is determined by the superposition of neighboring modules. One group of subjects adapted to a left-right reversal of visual feedback, which requires a 180°, ±90°, or no change of response direction, depending on target position. Two groups of control subjects adapted to a 180° and to a 90° rotation of visual feedback. We found that adaptation to a left-right reversal is less efficient than adaptation to rotations requiring the same adaptive change, and attribute this decrement to an overlap of neighboring modules. We further found that transfer to unpracticed targets is well predicted by a simple Gaussian model. From this we conclude that adaptation to a left-right reversal emerges in a regional and interdependent fashion, and can be modeled as overlapping Gaussian tuned processes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Alcohol-related falls are recognized as a major contributor to the occurrence of traumatic brain injury. The control of upright standing balance is complex and composes of contributions from several partly independent mechanisms such as appropriate information from multiple sensory systems and correct feedback and feed forward movement control. Analysis of multisegmented body movement offers a rarely used option for detecting the fine motor problems associated with alcohol intoxication. The study aims were to investigate whether (1) alcohol intoxication at 0.06 and 0.10% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) affected the body movements under unperturbed and perturbed standing; and (2) alcohol affected the ability for sensorimotor adaptation. Body movements were recorded in 25 participants (13women and 12 men, mean age 25.1 years) at five locations (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and head) during quiet standing and during balance perturbations from pseudorandom pulses of calf muscle vibration over 200. s with eyes closed or open. Tests were performed at 0.00, 0.06, and 0.10% BAC. The study revealed several significant findings: (1) an alcohol dose-specific effect; (2) a direction-specific stability decrease from alcohol intoxication; (3) a movement pattern change related to the level of alcohol intoxication during unperturbed standing and perturbed standing; (4) a sensorimotor adaptation deterioration with increased alcohol intoxication; and (5) that vision provided a weaker contribution to postural control during alcohol intoxication. Hence, alcohol intoxication at 0.06 and 0.10% BAC causes a complex multifaceted deterioration of human postural control. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The aim of our study was to explore whether or not different types of learners in a sensorimotor task possess characteristically different cognitive representations. Participants' sensorimotor adaptation performance was measured with a pointing paradigm which used a distortion of the visual feedback in terms of a left-right reversal. The structure of cognitive representations was assessed using a newly established experimental method, the Cognitive Measurement of Represented Directions. A post hoc analysis revealed inter-individual differences in participants' adaptation performance, and three different skill levels (skilled, average, and poor adapters) have been defined. These differences in performance were correlated with the structure of participants' cognitive representations of movement directions. Analysis of these cognitive representations revealed performance advantages for participants possessing a global cognitive representation of movement directions (aligned to cardinal movement axes), rather than a local representation (aligned to each neighboring direction). Our findings are evidence that cognitive representation structures play a functional role in adaptation performance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

abstract={Studies of intermanual transfer have been used to probe representations formed during skill acquisition. We employ a new method that provides a continuous assay of intermanual transfer, intermixing right-and left-hand trials while limiting visual feedback to right-hand movements. We manipulated the degree of awareness of the visuomotor rotation, introducing a 22.5° perturbation in either an abrupt single step or gradually in ~1° increments every 10 trials. Intermanual transfer was observed with the direction of left-hand movements shifting in the opposite direction of the rotation over the course of training. The transfer on left-hand trials was less than that observed in the right hand. Moreover, the magnitude of transfer was larger in our mixed-limb design compared with the standard blocked design in which transfer is only probed at the end of training. Transfer was similar in the abrupt and gradual groups, suggesting that awareness of the perturbation has little effect on intermanual transfer. In a final experiment, participants were provided with a strategy to offset an abrupt rotation, a method that has been shown to increase error over the course of training due to the operation of sensorimotor adaptation. This deterioration was also observed on left-hand probe trials, providing further support that awareness has little effect on intermanual transfer. These results indicate that intermanual transfer is not dependent on the implementation of cognitively assisted strategies that participants might adopt when they become aware that the visuomotor mapping has been perturbed. Rather, the results indicate that the information available to processes involved in adaptation entails some degree of effector independence. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Sensorimotor integration is important for motor learning. The inferior parietal lobe, through its connections with the frontal lobe and cerebellum, has been associated with multisensory integration and sensorimotor adaptation for motor behaviors other than speech. In the present study, the contribution of the inferior parietal cortex to speech motor learning was evaluated using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) prior to a speech motor adaptation task. Subjects' auditory feedback was altered in a manner consistent with the auditory consequences of an unintended change in tongue position during speech production, and adaptation performance was used to evaluate sensorimotor plasticity and short-term learning. Prior to the feedback alteration, rTMS or sham stimulation was applied over the left supramarginal gyrus (SMG). Subjects who underwent the sham stimulation exhibited a robust adaptive response to the feedback alteration whereas subjects who underwent rTMS exhibited a diminished adaptive response. The results suggest that the inferior parietal region, in and around SMG, plays a role in sensorimotor adaptation for speech. The interconnections of the inferior parietal cortex with inferior frontal cortex, cerebellum and primary sensory areas suggest that this region may be an important component in learning and adapting sensorimotor patterns for speech. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Participants performed a visual-vestibular motor recalibration task in virtual reality. The task consisted of keeping the extended arm and hand stable in space during a whole-body rotation induced by a robotic wheelchair. Performance was first quantified in a pre-test in which no visual feedback was available during the rotation. During the subsequent adaptation phase, optical flow resulting from body rotation was provided. This visual feedback was manipulated to create the illusion of a smaller rotational movement than actually occurred, hereby altering the visual-vestibular mapping. The effects of the adaptation phase on hand stabilization performance were measured during a post-test that was identical to the pre-test. Three different groups of subjects were exposed to different perspectives on the visual scene, i.e., first-person, top view, or mirror view. Sensorimotor adaptation occurred for all three viewpoint conditions, performance in the posttest session showing a marked under-compensation relative to the pre-test performance. In other words, all viewpoints gave rise to a remapping between vestibular input and the motor output required to stabilize the arm. Furthermore, the first-person and mirror view adaptation induced a significant decrease in variability of the stabilization performance. Such variability reduction was not observed for the top view adaptation. These results suggest that even if all three viewpoints can evoke substantial adaptation aftereffects, the more naturalistic first-person view and the richer mirror view should be preferred when reducing motor variability constitutes an important issue. © Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract={We investigated auditory and somatosensory feedback contributions to the neural control of speech. In task I, sensorimotor adaptation was studied by perturbing one of these sensory modalities or both modalities simultaneously. The first formant (F1) frequency in the auditory feedback was shifted up by a real-time processor and/or the extent of jaw opening was increased or decreased with a force field applied by a robotic device. All eight subjects lowered F1 to compensate for the up-shifted F1 in the feedback signal regardless of whether or not the jaw was perturbed. Adaptive changes in subjects' acoustic output resulted from adjustments in articulatory movements of the jaw or tongue. Adaptation in jaw opening extent in response to the mechanical perturbation occurred only when no auditory feedback perturbation was applied or when the direction of adaptation to the force was compatible with the direction of adaptation to a simultaneous acoustic perturbation. In tasks II and III, subjects' auditory and somatosensory precision and accuracy were estimated. Correlation analyses showed that the relationships 1) between F1 adaptation extent and auditory acuity for F1 and 2) between jaw position adaptation extent and somatosensory acuity for jaw position were weak and statistically not significant. Taken together, the combined findings from this work suggest that, in speech production, sensorimotor adaptation updates the underlying control mechanisms in such a way that the planning of vowel-related articulatory movements takes into account a complex integration of error signals from previous trials but likely with a dominant role for the auditory modality. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Purpose: A feedback perturbation paradigm was used to investigate whether prosodic cues are controlled independently or in an integrated fashion during sentence production. Method: Twenty-one healthy speakers of American English were asked to produce sentences with emphatic stress while receiving real-time auditory feedback of their productions. The fundamental frequency (F0) of the stressed word in each 4-word sentence was selectively shifted in a sensorimotor adaptation protocol. Speakers experienced either an upward or a downward shift of the stressed word, which gradually altered the perceived stress of the sentence. Results: Participants in the Up and Down groups adapted to F0 shifts by altering the contrast between stressed and unstressed words differentially, such that the two groups deviated from each other in the perturbation phase. Furthermore, selective F0 perturbation in sentences with emphatic stress resulted in compensatory changes in both F0 and intensity. Conclusions: Present findings suggest that F0 and intensity are controlled in an integrated fashion to maintain the contrast between stressed and unstressed words. When a cue is impaired through perturbation, speakers not only oppose the perturbation but enhance other prosodic cues to achieve emphatic stress.©American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation of point-to-point arm movements after spaceflight: the role of internal representation of gravity force in trajectory planning. J Neurophysiol 106: 620-629, 2011. First published May 11, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00081.2011-After an exposure to weightlessness, the central nervous system operates under new dynamic and sensory contexts. To find optimal solutions for rapid adaptation, cosmonauts have to decide whether parameters from the world or their body have changed and to estimate their properties. Here, we investigated sensorimotor adaptation after a spaceflight of 10 days. Five cosmonauts performed forward point-to-point arm movements in the sagittal plane 40 days before and 24 and 72 h after the spaceflight. We found that, whereas the shape of hand velocity profiles remained unaffected after the spaceflight, hand path curvature significantly increased 1 day after landing and returned to the preflight level on the third day. Control experiments, carried out by 10 subjects under normal gravity conditions, showed that loading the arm with varying loads (from 0.3 to 1.350 kg) did not affect path curvature. Therefore, changes in path curvature after spaceflight cannot be the outcome of a control process based on the subjective feeling that arm inertia was increased. By performing optimal control simulations, we found that arm kinematics after exposure to microgravity corresponded to a planning process that overestimated the gravity level and optimized movements in a hypergravity environment (~1.4 g). With time and practice, the sensorimotor system was recalibrated to Earth's gravity conditions, and cosmonauts progressively generated accurate estimations of the body state, gravity level, and sensory consequences of the motor commands (72 h). These observations provide novel insights into how the central nervous system evaluates body (inertia) and environmental (gravity) states during sensorimotor adaptation of point-to-point arm movements after an exposure to weightlessness. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Recent research has demonstrated that adaptation to a visuomotor distortion systematically influenced movements to auditory targets in adults and typically developing (TD) children, suggesting that the adaptation of spatial-to-motor transformations for reaching movements is multisensory (i.e., generalizable across sensory modalities). The multisensory characteristics of these transformations in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have not been examined. Given that previous research has demonstrated that children with DCD have deficits in sensorimotor integration, these children may also have impairments in the formation of multisensory spatial-to-motor transformations for target-directed arm movements. To investigate this hypothesis, children with and without DCD executed discrete arm movements to visual and acoustic targets prior to and following exposure to an abrupt visual feedback rotation. Results demonstrated that the magnitudes of the visual aftereffects were equivalent in the TD children and the children with DCD, indicating that both groups of children adapted similarly to the visuomotor perturbation. Moreover, the influence of visuomotor adaptation on auditory-motor performance was similar in the two groups of children. This suggests that the multisensory processes underlying adaptation of spatial-to-motor transformations are similar in children with DCD and TD children. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Previous research investigating children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) has consistently reported increased intra- and inter-individual variability during motor skill performance. Statistically characterizing this variability is not only critical for the analysis and interpretation of behavioral data, but also may facilitate our understanding of the processes underlying DCD. Thus, the primary purpose of this research was to demonstrate the utility of a flexible statistical technique, a random coefficient model (RCM), that characterizes the increased intra- and inter-individual variability in children with and without DCD. We analyzed data from a sensorimotor adaptation task during which participants executed discrete aiming movements under conditions of rotated visual feedback. To highlight the advantages of this statistical approach, we contrasted the results from the RCM with those from a traditionally employed general linear model (GLM). The RCM revealed differences between the two groups of children that the GLM did not detect; and, characterized trajectories of change for each individual. The RCM provides researchers an opportunity to probe behavioral deficits at the individual level and may provide new insights into the behavioral heterogeneity in children with DCD. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Although sensorimotor adaptation is typically thought of as an implicit form of learning, it has been shown that participants who gain explicit awareness of the nature of the perturbation during adaptation exhibit more learning than those who do not. With rare exceptions, however, explicit awareness is typically polled at the end of the study. Here, we provided participants with either an explicit spatial strategy or no instructions before learning. Early in learning, explicit instructions greatly reduced movement errors but also resulted in increased trial-to-trial variability and longer reaction times. Late in adaptation, performance was indistinguishable between the explicit and implicit groups, but the mechanisms underlying performance improvements remained fundamentally different, as revealed by catch trials. The progression of implicit recalibration in the explicit group was modulated by the use of an explicit strategy: these participants showed a lower level of recalibration as well as decreased aftereffects. This phenomenon may be due to the reduced magnitude of errors made to the target during adaptation or inhibition of implicit learning mechanisms by explicit processing. © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Three experiments were designed to test whether perception and action are coordinated in a way that distinguishes sequencing from timing (Pfordresher, 2003). Each experiment incorporated a trial design in which altered auditory feedback (AAF) was presented for varying lengths of time and then withdrawn. Experiments 1 and 2 included AAF that resulted in action-effect asynchronies (delayed auditory feedback) during simple tapping (Experiment 1) and melody production (Experiment 2). Asynchronous AAF immediately slowed production; this effect then diminished rapidly after removal of AAF. By contrast, sequential alterations of feedback pitch during melody production (Experiment 3) had an effect that varied over successive presentations of AAF (by increasing error rates) that lasted after its withdrawal. The presence of auditory feedback after withdrawal of asynchronous AAF (Experiments 1 and 2) led to overcompensation of timing, whereas the presence of auditory feedback did not influence performance after withdrawal of AAF in Experiment 3. Based on these results, we suggest that asynchronous AAF perturbs the phase of an internal timekeeper, whereas alterations to feedback pitch over time degrade the internal representation of sequence structure. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={If proprioceptive feedback is degraded by agonist-antagonist muscle vibration, then adaptation to rotated vision remains intact while adaptation to a velocity-dependent force field worsens. Here we evaluate whether this differential effect of vibration is related to the physical nature of the distortion - visual versus mechanical - or to their kinematic coupling to the subjects' hand - velocity versus position dependent. Subjects adapted to a velocity-dependent visual distortion, to a position-dependent force, or to a velocity-dependent force; one half of the subjects adapted with, and the other half without agonist-antagonist vibration at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder. We found, as before, that vibration slowed down adaptation to a velocity-dependent force. However, vibration did not modify adaptation to the other two distortions, nor did it influence the aftereffects of any distortion. From this we conclude that intact proprioception supports strategic compensatory processes when proprioceptive signals agree with visual ones, and provide relevant (dynamic) information not available to the visual system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Basic features of objects and events in the environment such as timing and spatial location are encoded by multiple sensory modalities. This redundancy in sensory coding allows recalibration of one sense by other senses if there is a conflict between the sensory maps (Radeau and Bertelson, 1974; Zwiers et al., 2003; Navarra et al., 2009). In contrast to motor or sensorimotor adaptation, which can be relatively rapid, cross-sensory recalibration (the change in an isolated sensory representation after exposure to conflicting cross-modal information) has been reported only as a result of an extensive amount of exposure to sensory discrepancy (e.g., hundreds or thousands of trials, or prolonged durations). Therefore, sensory recalibration has traditionally been associated with compensation for permanent changes that would occur during development or after traumatic injuries or stroke. Nonetheless, the dynamics of sensory recalibration is unknown, and it is unclear whether prolonged inconsistency is required to trigger recalibration or whether such mechanisms are continuously engaged in self-maintenance. We show that in humans recalibration of perceived auditory space by vision can occur after a single exposure to discrepant auditory-visual stimuli lasting only a few milliseconds. These findings suggest an impressive degree of plasticity in a basic perceptual map induced by a cross-modal error signal. Therefore, it appears that modification of sensory maps does not necessarily require accumulation of a substantial amount of evidence of error to be triggered, and is continuously operational. This scheme of sensory recalibration has many advantages. It only requires a small working memory capacity, and allows rapid adaptation to transient changes in the environment as well as the body.

abstract={Neural systems that control movement maintain accuracy by adaptively altering motor commands in response to errors. It is often assumed that the error signal that drives adaptation is equivalent to the sensory error observed at the conclusion of a movement; for saccades, this is typically the visual (retinal) error. However, we instead propose that the adaptation error signal is derived as the difference between the observed visual error and a realistic prediction of movement outcome. Using a modified saccade-adaptation task in human subjects, we precisely controlled the amount of error experienced at the conclusion of a movement by back-stepping the target so that the saccade is hypometric (positive retinal error), but less hypometric than if the target had not moved (smaller retinal error than expected). This separates prediction error from both visual errors and motor corrections. Despite positive visual errors and forward-directed motor corrections, we found an adaptive decrease in saccade amplitudes, a finding that is well-explained by the employment of a prediction-based error signal. Furthermore, adaptive changes in movement size were linearly correlated to the disparity between the predicted and observed movement outcomes, in agreement with the forward-model hypothesis of motor learning, which states that adaptation error signals incorporate predictions of motor outcomes computed using a copy of the motor command (efference copy). © 2011 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Visuomotor rotation tasks have proven to be a powerful tool to study adaptation of the motor system. While adaptation in such tasks is seemingly automatic and incremental, participants may gain knowledge of the perturbation and invoke a compensatory strategy. When provided with an explicit strategy to counteract a rotation, participants are initially very accurate, even without on-line feedback. Surprisingly, with further testing, the angle of their reaching movements drifts in the direction of the strategy, producing an increase in endpoint errors. This drift is attributed to the gradual adaptation of an internal model that operates independently from the strategy, even at the cost of task accuracy. Here we identify constraints that influence this process, allowing us to explore models of the interaction between strategic and implicit changes during visuomotor adaptation. When the adaptation phase was extended, participants eventually modified their strategy to offset the rise in endpoint errors. Moreover, when we removed visual markers that provided external landmarks to support a strategy, the degree of drift was sharply attenuated. These effects are accounted for by a setpoint state-space model in which a strategy is flexibly adjusted to offset performance errors arising from the implicit adaptation of an internal model. More generally, these results suggest that strategic processes may operate in many studies of visuomotor adaptation, with participants arriving at a synergy between a strategic plan and the effects of sensorimotor adaptation. © 2011 Taylor, Ivry.},

abstract={In many robot-assisted rehabilitation and motor skill learning applications, robots generate forces that facilitate movement performance. While there is some evidence that assistance is beneficial, the underlying mechanisms of action are largely unknown, and it is unclear what force patterns are more effective. Here, we investigate how reaching movements (and their neural correlates) are altered by 'assistive' forces. Subjects performed center-out reaching movements, under the influence of a robot-generated force, constant in magnitude and always directed toward the target. The experimental protocol included three phases: (1) baseline (no forces), (2) force field (with two different force levels, 3 N and 6 N, applied in random order), and (3) after-effect (no forces). EEG activity was recorded from motor and frontal cortical areas. In both movement kinematics and EEG activity, we looked at the effects of forces, of adaptation to such forces and at the aftereffects of such adaptation. Assistive forces initially induced a degraded performance and in general alterations in movement kinematics. However, subjects quickly adapted to the perturbation by improving their performance. With regard to EEG activity, we found (1) an increased beta band synchronization just before movements and an alpha band synchronization in the ipsilateral hemisphere, both proportional to force magnitude; (2) a gradual decrease in alpha band synchronization with practice in the contralateral hemisphere; (3) an increase in theta band synchronization in the later stage of the force epochs; and (4) an ipsilateral to contralateral shift (from baseline to aftereffect) of theta band synchronization. These results point to the need for a careful design of assistive forces to effectively facilitate motor performance and motor learning. Moreover, EEG signals exhibit distinct features related to force and adaptation. Therefore, at least in principle, the latter might be used to monitor the learning process and/or to regulate the amount of assistance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Background: Recent neuroimaging studies point to a possible pathophysiological role of cerebellar dysfunction in dystonia. The authors investigated the association between sensorimotor adaptation, cerebellar dysfunction and the myoclonus-dystonia phenotype. Methods: The authors prospectively analysed reactive saccade adaptation in a genetically homogeneous group of 14 patients with DYT11 dystonia owing to a mutation of the SGCE gene. The authors used a backward reactive saccade adaptation task, a well-characterised experimental oculomotor paradigm involving the cerebellum. The principle of this paradigm is to simulate a spatial error in saccade generation by systematically shifting a visual target during saccade execution. Repetition of this systematic error induces a gradual decrease in the initial saccade amplitude, reflecting an adaptive phenomenon. Results: Saccade adaptation was significantly lower in the DYT11 patients than in healthy controls (mean value: 8.9%±4.5% vs 21.6%±4.5%; p=8.3×10 -6). The time course of adaptation also differed between the patients and controls (p=0.002), reflecting the slower saccadic adaptation in the patients. Conclusions: This study provides the first neurophysiological evidence of cerebellar dysfunction in DYT11 dystonia and supports a role of cerebellar dysfunction in the myoclonus-dystonia phenotype.},

abstract={In sensorimotor adaptation, explicit cognitive strategies are thought to be unnecessary because the motor system implicitly corrects performance throughout training. This seemingly automatic process involves computing an error between the planned movement and actual feedback of the movement. When explicitly provided with an effective strategy to overcome an experimentally induced visual perturbation, people are immediately successful and regain good task performance. However, as training continues, their accuracy gets worse over time. This counterintuitive result has been attributed to the independence of implicit motor processes and explicit cognitive strategies. The cerebellum has been hypothesized to be critical for the computation of the motor error signals that are necessary for implicit adaptation. We explored this hypothesis by testing patients with cerebellar degeneration on a motor learning task that puts the explicit and implicit systems in conflict. Given this, we predicted that the patients would be better than controls in maintaining an effective strategy assuming strategic and adaptive processes are functionally and neurally independent. Consistent with this prediction, the patients were easily able to implement an explicit cognitive strategy and showed minimal interference from undesirable motor adaptation throughout training. These results further reveal the critical role of the cerebellum in an implicit adaptive process based on movement errors and suggest an asymmetrical interaction of implicit and explicit processes. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Bilateral interference, referring to the tendency of movements of one arm to disrupt the intended movements made simultaneously with the other arm, is often observed in a task that involves differential planning of each arm movement during sensorimotor adaptation. In the present study, we examined two questions: 1) how does the compatibility between visuomotor adaptation tasks performed with both arms affect bilateral interference during bimanual performance? and 2) how do variations in bilateral interference affect transfer of visuomotor adaptation between bilateral and unilateral conditions? To examine these questions, we manipulated visuomotor compatibility using two kinematic variables (direction of required hand motion, direction of an imposed visual rotation). Experiment 1 consisted of two conditions in which the direction of visual rotations for both arms was either in the same or opposing directions, whereas the target direction for both arms was always the same. In experiment 2, we examined the pattern of generalization between the bilateral and unilateral conditions when both the target and rotation directions were opposing between the arms. In both experiments, subjects first adapted to a 30° visual rotation with one arm (preunilateral), then with both arms (bilateral), and finally with the arm that was not used in the first session (postunilateral). Our results show that bilateral interference was smallest when both variables were the same between the arms. Our data also show extensive transfer of visuomotor adaptation between bilateral and unilateral conditions, regardless of degree of bilateral interference.

abstract={Recent human-machine interaction studies have suggested that movement augmented with negative viscosity can enhance performance and can even promote better motor learning. To test this, we investigated how negative viscosity influences motor adaptation to an environment where forces acted only in one axis of motion. Using a force-feedback device, subjects performed free exploratory movements with a purely inertia generating forces proportional to hand acceleration, negative viscosity generating destabilizing forces proportional to hand velocity, or a combination of the acceleration and velocity fields. After training, we evaluated each subject's ability to perform circular movements in only the inertial field. Combined training resulted in lowest error and revealed similar responses as inertia training in catch trials. These findings are remarkable because negative viscosity, available only during training, evidently enhanced learning when combined with inertia. This success in generalization is consistent with the ability of the nervous system to decompose the perturbing forces into velocity and acceleration dependent components. Compared with inertia, the combined group exhibited a broader range of speeds along the direction of maximal perturbing force. Broader exploration was also correlated with better performance in subsequent evaluation trials; this suggests that negative viscosity improved performance by enhancing identification of each force field. These findings shed light on a new way to enhance sensorimotor adaptation through robot-applied augmentation of mechanics. Copyright © 2010 The American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Introduction: Two previous single-case studies found that the dual- task costs of manual tracking plus memory search increased during a space mission, and concluded that sensorimotor deficits during spaceflight may be related to cognitive overload. Since dual-task costs were insensitive to the difficulty of memory search, the authors argued that the overload may reflect stress-related problems of multitasking, rather than a scarcity of specific cognitive resources. Here we expand the available database and compare different types of concurrent task. Methods: Three subjects were repeatedly tested before, during, and after an extended mission on the International Space Station (ISS). They performed an unstable tracking task and four reaction-time tasks, both separately and concurrently. Inflight data could only be obtained during later parts of the mission. Results: The tracking error increased from pre- to in flight by a factor of about 2, both under single- and dual-task conditions. The dual-task costs with a reaction-time task requiring rhythm production was 2.4 times higher than with a reaction-time task requiring visuo-spatial transformations, and 8 times higher than with a regular choice reaction-time task. Conclusions: Long-term sensorimotor deficits during spaceflight may reflect not only stress, but also a scarcity of resources related to complex motor programming; possibly those resources are tied up by sensorimotor adaptation to the space environment.

abstract={It is well established that listening to music can modify subjects' cognitive performance. The present study evaluates whether this so-called Mozart Effect extends beyond cognitive tasks and includes sensorimotor adaptation. Three subject groups listened to musical pieces that in the author's judgment were serene, neutral, or sad, respectively. This judgment was confirmed by the subjects' introspective reports. While listening to music, subjects engaged in a pointing task that required them to adapt to rotated visual feedback. All three groups adapted successfully, but the speed and magnitude of adaptive improvement was more pronounced with serene music than with the other two music types. In contrast, aftereffects upon restoration of normal feedback were independent of music type. These findings support the existence of a "Mozart effect" for strategic movement control, but not for adaptive recalibration. Possibly, listening to music modifies neural activity in an intertwined cognitive-emotional network. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Using a sequential-exposure approach, we examined sensorimotor adaptation of precision grip orientation to a visuo-haptic mismatch. Subjects (n = 41) were asked to grasp with thumb and index finger mirror-viewed objects. They could not see their hand due to the mirror, but they could feel an object located behind the mirror in the same place as the viewed object. When a -15° orientation mismatch between viewed and felt object was introduced, subjects adapted to it by gradually modifying the orientation of their finger opposition axis. When the visuo-haptic mismatch further changed to -30° or to +15°, subjects continued to perform according to their pre-established adaptive state, and gradually modified it until it became adequate for the new mismatch. This outcome supports the existence of a continuously acting mechanism for grasping adaptation, similar to that previously described for pointing and tracking adaptation. Precision grip adaptation generalized to unpracticed object orientations, which suggests that adaptation was based on a sensorimotor recalibration rather than the learning of specific stimulus-response pairs. Transfer to pointing movements was found only when similarity to the grasp adaptation task was high. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Behavioral studies suggest that the adaptation of planar arm movements to rotated visual feedback is achieved by the interplay of a gradual process which slowly rotates participants' responses by up to +/-90°, and a discrete process which changes the responses by means of axis inversion. The processes for adaptation to left-right reversed visual feedback are far less well understood. To clarify this issue, 12 healthy participants performed pointing movements to targets presented in eight different directions, before and during exposure to left-right reversed visual feedback. We quantified the direction of each response 150. ms after movement onset and analyzed the time-course of those directions throughout the adaptation phase, separately for different targets. For targets along the axis of inversion, we only found an increase of response variability, for targets perpendicular to that axis, we observed a discrete 180° change of response direction, and for diagonal targets, we found a discrete 180° change followed by a gradual " backward" shift of 90°. The present findings confirm that sensorimotor adaptation is based on discrete and gradual processes, that both types of processes can occur concurrently, and suggests that those processes can contribute to adaptation in a target-specific fashion. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={It is widely held that sensorimotor adaptation to different distortions is brought about by separate, distortion-specific processes which compete for the limited resources of short-term motor memory when they are activated in close temporal succession. Here we scrutinized this view by exposing participants sequentially to two distortions of equal or of opposite polarity, one proportional to the position, and the other to the velocity of their hand. We found movement errors to be largest in participants who were pre-adapted to a distortion of different type and opposite polarity, smaller in novice participants, and smaller still in participants who were pre-adapted to a distortion of different type and same polarity. The interference observed with opposite-polarity distortions can be explained by the existence of competing, independent, or cooperative adaptive processes. However, the facilitation observed with equal-polarity distortions is in quantitative disagreement with the competing- and independent-processes view, but is consistent with the cooperative-processes view. We therefore conclude that adaptation to position- and velocity-dependent visual distortions can be based on cooperative processes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Vocal sensory-motor adaptation is typically studied by introducing a prolonged change in auditory feedback. While it may be preferable to perform multiple blocks of adaptation within a single experiment, it is possible that a carry-over effect from previous blocks of adaptation may affect the results of subsequent blocks. Speakers were asked to vocalize an /a/ sound and match a target note during ten adaptation blocks. Each block represented a unique combination of target note and shift direction. The adaptation response was found to be similar for all blocks, indicating that there were no carry-over effects from previous blocks of adaptation. © 2010 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Motor control and adaptation are multi-determinate processes with complex interactions. This is reflected for example in the ambiguous nature of interactions during sequential adaptation of reaching under kinematics and dynamics perturbations. It has been suggested that perturbations based on the same kinematic parameter interfere. Others posited that opposing motor adjustments underlie interference. Here, we examined the influence of discordances in task and in motor adjustments on sequential adaptations to visuomotor rotation and viscous force field perturbations. These two factors-perturbation direction and task discordance-have been examined separately by previous studies, thus the inherent difficulty to identify the roots of interference. Forty-eight human subjects adapted sequentially to one or two types of perturbations, of matched or confl icting directions. We found a gradient of interaction effects based on perturbation direction and task discordance. Perturbations of matched directions showed facilitation while perturbations of opposite directions, which required opposing motor adjustments, interfered with each other. Further, interaction effects increased with greater task discordance. We also found that force field and visuomotor rotation had mutual anterograde and retrograde effects. However, we found independence between anterograde and retrograde interferences between similar tasks. The results suggest that the newly acquired internal models of kinematic and dynamic perturbations are not independent but they share common neuronal resources and interact between them. Such overlap does not necessarily imply competition of resources. Rather, our results point to an additional principle of sensorimotor adaptation allowing the system to tap or harness common features across diverse sensory inputs and task contexts whenever available. © 2010 Arce, Novick, and Vaadia.},

abstract={In order to test whether auditory feedback is involved in the planning of complex articulatory gestures in time-varying phonemes, the current study examined native Mandarin speakers' responses to auditory perturbations of their auditory feedback of the trajectory of the first formant frequency during their production of the triphthong /iau/. On average, subjects adaptively adjusted their productions to partially compensate for the perturbations in auditory feedback. This result indicates that auditory feedback control of speech movements is not restricted to quasi-static gestures in monophthongs as found in previous studies, but also extends to time-varying gestures. To probe the internal structure of the mechanisms of auditory-motor transformations, the pattern of generalization of the adaptation learned on the triphthong /iau/ to other vowels with different temporal and spatial characteristics (produced only under masking noise) was tested. A broad but weak pattern of generalization was observed; the strength of the generalization diminished with increasing dissimilarity from /iau/. The details and implications of the pattern of generalization are examined and discussed in light of previous sensorimotor adaptation studies of both speech and limb motor control and a neurocomputational model of speech motor control.},

abstract={Background:Hearing ability is essential for normal speech development, however the precise mechanisms linking auditory input and the improvement of speaking ability remain poorly understood. Auditory feedback during speech production is believed to play a critical role by providing the nervous system with information about speech outcomes that is used to learn and subsequently fine-tune speech motor output. Surprisingly, few studies have directly investigated such auditorymotor learning in the speech production of typically developing children. Methodology/Principal Findings:In the present study, we manipulated auditory feedback during speech production in a group of 9-11-year old children, as well as in adults. Following a period of speech practice under conditions of altered auditory feedback, compensatory changes in speech production and perception were examined. Consistent with prior studies, the adults exhibited compensatory changes in both their speech motor output and their perceptual representations of speech sound categories. The children exhibited compensatory changes in the motor domain, with a change in speech output that was similar in magnitude to that of the adults, however the children showed no reliable compensatory effect on their perceptual representations. Conclusions:The results indicate that 9-11-year-old children, whose speech motor and perceptual abilities are still not fully developed, are nonetheless capable of auditory-feedback-based sensorimotor adaptation, supporting a role for such learning processes in speech motor development. Auditory feedback may play a more limited role, however, in the finetuning of children's perceptual representations of speech sound categories. © 2010 Shiller et al.},

abstract={Is plasticity in sensory and motor systems linked? Here, in the context of speech motor learning and perception, we test the idea sensory function is modified by motor learning and, in particular, that speech motor learning affects a speaker's auditory map. We assessed speech motor learning by using a robotic device that displaced the jaw and selectively altered somatosensory feedback during speech. We found that with practice speakers progressively corrected for the mechanical perturbation and after motor learning they also showed systematic changes in their perceptual classification of speech sounds. The perceptual shift was tied to motor learning. Individuals that displayed greater amounts of learning also showed greater perceptual change. Perceptual change was not observed in control subjects that produced the same movements, but in the absence of a force field, nor in subjects that experienced the force field but failed to adapt to the mechanical load. The perceptual effects observed here indicate the involvement of the somatosensory system in the neural processing of speech sounds and suggest that speech motor learning results in changes to auditory perceptual function.},

abstract={Error detection and correction are essential components of motor skill learning. These processes have been well characterized in cognitive psychology using electroencephalography (EEG) to record an event-related potential (ERP) called error-related negativity (ERN). However, it is unclear whether this ERP component is sensitive to the magnitude of the error made in a sensorimotor adaptation task. In the present study, we tested the function of error-related activity in a visuomotor adaptation task. To examine whether error size is reflected in the ERP, two groups of participants adapted manual aiming movements to either a small (30°) or large (45°) rotation of the visual feedback display. Each participant's trials were sorted into large and small error trials using a median split to examine potential error magnitude waveform differences. We also examined these trial types at the early and late stages of adaptation. There were no group differences for the behavioral or neural measures; however, waveforms from large error trials were significantly different from small error trials. The waveforms also changed as a function of practice as early adaptation waveforms were larger than late adaptation waveforms. The observed ERP component reflected differences in error magnitude with the amount of activity corresponding to the size of the error. Movement monitoring potentials likely affected the frequency and time course of the waveform so that it did not resemble the typical ERN; however, error-related activity was still distinguishable. The present findings are discussed in terms of current theories of the ERN as well as skill acquisition. Copyright © 2009 The American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Reaching to visual targets engages the nervous system in a series of transformations between sensory information and motor commands. That which remains to be determined is the extent to which the processes that mediate sensorimotor adaptation to novel environments engage neural circuits that represent the required movement in joint-based or muscle-based coordinate systems. We sought to establish the contribution of these alternative representations to the process of visuomotor adaptation. To do so we applied a visuomotor rotation during a center-out isometric torque production task that involved flexion/extension and supination/ pronation at the elbow-joint complex. In separate sessions, distinct half-quadrant rotations (i.e., 45° ) were applied such that adaptation could be achieved either by only rescaling the individual joint torques (i.e., the visual target and torque target remained in the same quadrant) or by additionally requiring torque reversal at a contributing joint (i.e., the visual target and torque target were in different quadrants). Analysis of the time course of directional errors revealed that the degree of adaptation was lower (by ∼20%) when reversals in the direction of joint torques were required. It has been established previously that in this task space, a transition between supination and pronation requires the engagement of a different set of muscle synergists, whereas in a transition between flexion and extension no such change is required. The additional observation that the initial level of adaptation was lower and the subsequent aftereffects were smaller, for trials that involved a pronation-supination transition than for those that involved a flexion-extension transition, supports the conclusion that the process of adaptation engaged, at least in part, neural circuits that represent the required motor output in a muscle-based coordinate system.

abstract={When a body movement systematically co-occurs with a stimulus, a change in perception to compensate for this correlation may occur. In Experiment 1 (similar to A. Bompas & J. K. O'Regan, 2006), we induced a correlation between leftward eye saccades and a red stimulus, and rightward eye saccades and a green stimulus. In a subsequent test phase, observers compared the color of two stimuli after leftward and rightward saccades. The major result was that stimuli tended to look greener after a leftward saccade and redder after a rightward saccade (A. Bompas & J. K. O'Regan, 2006). Measured here in meaningful units for the first time, the shift in the point of subjective equality was EdV= 0.4, a remarkably large effect for only 40 minutes of eye movement/ color exposure. A control experiment ruled out a simple reduction in initial bias as the cause of the effect. In Experiment 2, we hypothesized that the blue of the sky might cause an initial bias to judge spots seen with upward gaze as "yellower"; this expectation was not met, but the basic effect was replicated and extended to other chromaticities and eye movement directions. Experiment 3 substituted listening to tones for the eye movements (a sensorisensory correlation) to explore differences between sensorimotor adaptation and sensory integration; neither effect was found for our task. Sensorimotor adaptation can be a remarkably powerful influence on perception; because it operates in a compensatory direction, it may oppose the effects of sensory integration, depending upon task demands. © ARVO.},

abstract={Clinical and neuroimaging studies provide converging evidence that the cerebellum plays an important role for sensorimotor adaptation by participating in the adaptive process per se, and/or by evaluating motor performance errors as a prerequisite for adaptation. Recent experimental evidence suggests that error signals pertinent to adaptation are related to sensory prediction rather than to online corrections (Tseng et al. in J Neurophysiol 98(1):54-62, 2007). To further elucidate the role of the cerebellum, the present study uses a multiple regression approach to separate out three independent determinants of adaptive success. Seventeen patients with cerebellar atrophy but without extra-cerebellar lesions, and 17 healthy, sex- and age-matched controls participated. Both subject groups performed center-out pointing movements before, during, and after exposure to 60° rotated visual feedback. From the registered data, we quantified four indicators of adaptive success (adaptive improvement, retention without feedback, intermanual transfer, and de-adaptation under normal feedback), as well as five measures of motor performance (reaction time, peak velocity, movement time, response variability, and ability for online error corrections). The variance of each adaptation indicator was then partitioned into three components, one related to subject group but not to motor performance, a second related to group and motor performance, and a third related to motor performance but not to group. In accordance with previous work, adaptation and motor performance were degraded in patients. The deficit was similar in magnitude for all four adaptation indicators, which suggests that adaptive recalibration rather than strategic control were affected in our patients. No adaptation indicator shared statistically significant variance with group alone; we therefore found no evidence for cerebellar circuitry dedicated to adaptation but not motor performance. Three indicators shared significant variance jointly with group and motor performance; this suggests that the cerebellar contribution to motor performance is related to adaptive success. All four indicators shared significant variance with motor performance alone; this indicates that extracerebellar contributions to motor performance are also related to adaptive success. In conclusion, our data support the view that neural structures inside and outside the cerebellum are processing motor performance-related signals as a prerequisite for adaptation, but provide no evidence for a cerebellar structure related exclusively to adaptation.},

abstract={A visuo-motor adaptation task was used to investigate the effects of this adaptation on the auditory-motor representation during reaching movements. We show that, following exposure to a rotated screen cursor-hand relationship, the movement paths during auditory conditions exhibited a similar pattern of aftereffects as those observed during movements to visual targets, indicating that the newly formed model of visuo-motor transformations for hand movement was available to the auditory-motor network for planning the hand movements. This plasticity in human sound localization does not require active cross-modal experience, and retention tests indicated that the newly formed internal model does not reside primarily within the central auditory system as suggested in past studies examining the plasticity of sound localization to distorted spatial vision. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Acute exercise has been shown to exhibit different effects on human sensorimotor behavior; however, the causes and mechanisms of the responses are often not clear. The primary aim of the present study was to determine the effects of incremental running until exhaustion on sensorimotor performance and adaptation in a tracking task. Subjects were randomly assigned to a running group (RG), a tracking group (TG), or a running followed by tracking group (RTG), with 10 subjects assigned to each group. Treadmill running velocity was initially set at 2.0 m s- 1, increasing by 0.5 m s- 1 every 5 min until exhaustion. Tracking consisted of 35 episodes (each 40 s) where the subjects' task was to track a visual target on a computer screen while the visual feedback was veridical (performance) or left-right reversed (adaptation). Resting electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded before and after each experimental condition (running, tracking, rest). Tracking performance and the final amount of adaptation did not differ between groups. However, task adaptation was significantly faster in RTG compared to TG. In addition, increased alpha and beta power were observed following tracking in TG but not RTG although exhaustive running failed to induce significant changes in these frequency bands. Our results suggest that exhaustive running can facilitate adaptation processes in a manual tracking task. Attenuated cortical activation following tracking in the exercise condition was interpreted to indicate cortical efficiency and exercise-induced facilitation of selective central processes during actual task demands. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation restores and maintains the accuracy of goal-directed movements. It remains unclear whether these adaptive mechanisms modify actions by controlling peripheral premotor stages that send commands to the effectors and/or earlier processing stages involved in registration of target location. Here, we studied the effect of adaptation of saccadic eye movements, a well-established model of sensorimotor adaptation, in an antisaccade task. This task introduces a clear spatial dissociation between the actual target direction and the requested saccade direction because the correct movement direction is in the opposite direction from the target location. We used this requirement of a vector inversion to assess the level(s) of saccadic adaptation for two different types of adapted saccades. In two different experiments, we tested the transfer to antisaccades of the adaptation in one direction of reactive saccades to jumping targets and of scanning voluntary saccades within a target array. In the first experiment, we found that adaptation of reactive saccades transferred only to antisaccades in the adapted direction. In contrast, in the second experiment, adaptation of scanning voluntary saccades transferred to antisaccades in both the adapted and non-adapted directions. We conclude that adaptation of reactive saccades acts only downstream of the vector inversion required in the antisaccade task, whereas adaptation of voluntary saccades has a distributed influence, acting both upstream and downstream of vector inversion. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={Object. The goal of this study was to compare cortical sensorimotor adaptations associated with neurological deterioration and then recovery following surgical decompression for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). Methods. Eight patients with CSM underwent functional MR (fMR) imaging during wrist extension and the 3-finger pinch task, along with behavioral assessments before and 3 and 6 months after surgery. Six healthy control volunteers were scanned twice. Results. Cervical spine MR imaging demonstrated successful cord decompression. The patients improved after surgery on the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for the upper extremity, which correlated with the changes in task-associated activation in specific sensorimotor regions of interest. Pinch-related activation in sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the movement paradigm was reduced before surgery then increased toward the extent of healthy controls after surgery. Before surgery, patients showed broader activation in ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex during wrist extension than during pinch, but activations became similar to those of healthy controls after surgery. Pinch-related activation volume in the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex and the magnitude of activation in the contralateral dorsal premotor cortex evolved linearly across time after surgery, along with wrist extension-related activation magnitude in the contralateral supplementary motor area. Conclusions. Serial fMR imaging studies in CSM can capture the adaptations in specific sensorimotor cortices that accompany clinical deterioration and postsurgical improvement in sensorimotor function associated with damage and partial recovery of conduction in corticospinal pathways. These adaptive regions can be monitored by serial fMR imaging to detect a critical loss of supraspinal reserve in compensatory plasticity, which might augment clinical information about the need for surgical decompression.},

abstract={Intermanual transfer of skill learning has often been used as a paradigm to study functional specialization and hemispheric interactions in relation to handedness. This literature has not evaluated whether degree of handedness impacts learning and intermanual transfer. Because handedness scores are related to factors that might influence intermanual transfer, such as engagement of the ipsilateral hemisphere during movement (Dassonville et al. in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:14015-14018, 1997) and corpus callosum volume (Witelson in Science 229:665-668, 1985; Brain 112:799-835, 1989), we tested whether degree of handedness is correlated with transfer magnitude. We had groups of left and right handed participants perform a sensorimotor adaptation task and a sequence learning task. Following learning with either the dominant or nondominant hand, participants transferred to task performance with the other hand. We evaluated whether the magnitude of learning and intermanual transfer were influenced by either direction and/or degree of handedness. Participants exhibited faster sensorimotor adaptation with the right hand, regardless of whether they were right or left handed. In addition, less strongly left handed individuals exhibited better intermanual transfer of sensorimotor adaptation, while less strongly right handed individuals exhibited better intermanual transfer of sequence learning. The findings suggest that involvement of the ipsilateral hemisphere during learning may influence intermanual transfer magnitude. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation is thought to involve a remapping of the kinematic and kinetic parameters associated with movements performed within a changing environment. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are known to be affected on this type of learning process, although the specific role of dopamine depletion in these deficits has not yet been elucidated. The present study was an attempt to clarify whether dopamine depletion in PD may directly affect the capacity to internally reorganize the visuomotor remapping of a distorted environment. Fourteen PD patients were tested twice, while they were treated and while they were withdrawn from their regular levodopa treatment. Fourteen control subjects were also enrolled and tested twice. Two parallel forms of the Computed Mirror Pointing Task (CMPT), requiring making a reaching movement in a visually transformed environment (mirror inversion), were administered to each participant. Each of them had to perform 40 trials at each of the 2 testing sessions. At each trial, sensorimotor adaptation was evaluated by the initial direction angle (IDA), which reflects the direction of movement before any visually guided readjustment. Results revealed no IDA difference at baseline, between control subject and PD patients, whether they were treated or not. In all group, IDA values at that time were large, reflecting a tendency to make movements according to the real life visuomotor mapping (based on the natural direct vision). However, striking differences appeared during sensorimotor learning, in that IDA reduction along trials was poorer in patient not treated with levodopa than both control subjects and the same PD patient treated with levodopa. No difference was observed between the treated PD patients and control subjects. Given that IDA is thought to reflect the internal representation of the visuomotor mapping, it is concluded that dopamine depletion in PD would affects sensorimotor adaptation, in that it facilitates old and poorly adapted movements (real life mapping), instead of new and more adapted ones (mirror transformed mapping). © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Previous neuroimaging studies yielded different patterns of brain areas activated during sensorimotor adaptation, when sensory conflicts are introduced, e.g. by manipulating visual information. We propose that possible reasons might be the lack to control for adaptation or the change in motor performance. In consequence, it was not possible to distinguish between adaptation-related and error-related brain activations. We have developed a sensorimotor adaptation task which controls for these errors using two types of visual distortion and thus is suited to disambiguate sensorimotor adaptation from the related activation patterns. Twenty healthy subjects were scanned by fMRI during a tracking task, while adapting to a visual distortion, which depended either on hand position or on hand velocity. In either case, adaptation was interleaved with a control condition, designed such that the time-course of tracking errors approximated that under visual distortion. We found that adaptation-related neural activation was limited to the left supramarginal and angular gyrus under the position-dependent distortion, but extended bilaterally in the supramarginal gyrus, as well as in the left middle and right superior frontal gyrus under the velocity-dependent distortion. Our findings confirm that equating the errors under both conditions will yield an anatomically more restricted activation pattern compared with other studies. The additional recruitment in right parietal and bilateral frontal areas under the velocity-dependent distortion might reflect a higher computational demand, or the involvement of different adaptive mechanisms. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The goal of this study was to determine if prolonged exposure to perceptual-motor mismatch increased adaptability and retention of balance in older adults. Sixteen adults, aged 66 to 81 years, were randomized to one of two groups: either the control group (n = 8) or the experimental group (n = 8). Both groups first completed six trials of walking an obstacle course. Participants then trained twice a week for 4 weeks. In the training, the control group walked on a treadmill for 20 minutes while viewing a static visual scene and the experimental group walked on a treadmill for 20 minutes while viewing a rotating visual scene that provided a perceptual-motor mismatch. Following training, both groups were post-tested on the obstacle course. The experimental group moved faster through the obstacle course with fewer penalties. This training effect was retained for 4 weeks. Exposure to perceptual-motor mismatch induced an adaptive training effect that improved balance and locomotor control in older adults.

abstract={The control of a cursor on a computer monitor offers a simple means of exploring the limits of the plasticity of human visuomotor coordination. The authors explored the boundary conditions for adaptation to nonlinear visuomotor amplitude transformations. The authors hypothesized that only with terminal visual feedback during practice, but not with continuous visual feedback, humans might develop an internal model of the nonlinear visuomotor amplitude transformation. Thus, 2 groups were engaged in a sensorimotor adaptation task receiving either continuous or terminal visual feedback during the practice phase. In contrast to expectations, adaptive shifts and aftereffects observed in visual open-loop tests were linearly related to target amplitudes for both groups. Although the 2 feedback groups did not differ with respect to adaptive shifts and aftereffects, terminal visual feedback resulted in stable visual open-loop performance for an extended period, whereas movement errors increased after continuous visual feedback during practice. The benefit of continuous visual feedback, on the other hand, was faster closed-loop performance, indicating an optimization of visual closed-loop control. Copyright © 2008 Heldref Publications.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation, the ability to adjust motor output in response to persistent changes in sensory input, is a key function of the central nervous system. Although a great deal is known about vestibulo-ocular reflex and saccadic adaptation, relatively little is known about the behavior and neural mechanisms underlying gaze adaptation when the head is free to move. In an attempt to understand the mechanisms of gaze adaptation, and constrain hypotheses concerning the locus at which changes in gaze control may be implemented, we altered the size of large, head-unrestrained gaze shifts made to visual targets by surreptitiously moving the visual target forward (30° → 60°) or backwards (60° → 30°) during gaze shifts. In our 10 human subjects, after a few hundred back-step trials, gaze amplitudes were reduced by between 6° and 27°. Similarly, after a few hundred forward adaptation trials, our subjects increased gaze amplitude by between 0° and 26°. Changes in the amplitude of primary gaze shifts occurred regardless of the particular combinations of eye and head movements that made up the amplitude-altered gaze shifts. When gaze shifts were initiated with the eyes in systematically different positions relative to the head, the resulting changes in gaze, eye and head movement amplitudes were consistent with the hypothesis that gaze adaptation occurs at the level of a gaze shift command and not by altering separately the signals that produce eye and head movements. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation and sequence learning have often been treated as distinct forms of motor learning. But frequently the motor system must acquire both types of experience simultaneously. Here, we investigated the interaction of these two forms of motor learning by having subjects adapt to predictable forces imposed by a robotic manipulandum while simultaneously reaching to an implicit sequence of targets. We show that adaptation to novel dynamics and learning of a sequence of movements can occur simultaneously and without significant interference or facilitation. When both conditions were presented simultaneously to subjects, their trajectory error and reaction time decreased to the same extent as those of subjects who experienced the force field or sequence independently. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Investigations of intermanual transfer of learning have demonstrated that individuals can transfer acquired motor skills from one hand to the other. The purpose of the current study was to use fMRI to investigate the potential overlap of neural regions engaged during learning and at transfer of learning from the dominant arm to the non-dominant arm during sensorimotor adaptation. Participants performed a visuomotor adaptation joystick task where they adapted manual aiming movements to a 30° rotation of the visual feedback display. They performed eleven blocks (24 trials/block) of right-hand adaptation before performing the task with their left hand (transfer). Participants showed a selective transfer of learning effect: prior right-hand practice led to reduced endpoint errors but not trajectory errors for the left hand. This is consistent with work showing that the right arm is specialized for trajectory control while the left is specialized for endpoint control [Sainburg, R.L., 2005. Handedness, Differential specializations for control of trajectory and position. Exerc Sport Sci Rev 33, 206-213.]. Early adaptation processes were associated with activation in frontal and parietal regions, including bilateral dorsal premotor cortex. At transfer, activation was seen in the temporal cortex as well as the right medial frontal gyrus and the middle occipital gyrus. These regions have been observed in other studies during the late phases of sensorimotor adaptation. Integrating these data with the existing literature, we suggest that the left dorsal premotor cortex contributes to trajectory control, while the left visual and temporal cortices contribute to endpoint control. © 2007.},

abstract={The role of auditory feedback in speech motor control was explored in three related experiments. Experiment 1 investigated auditory sensorimotor adaptation: the process by which speakers alter their speech production to compensate for perturbations of auditory feedback. When the first formant frequency (F1) was shifted in the feedback heard by subjects as they produced vowels in consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words, the subjects' vowels demonstrated compensatory formant shifts that were maintained when auditory feedback was subsequently masked by noise-evidence of adaptation. Experiment 2 investigated auditory discrimination of synthetic vowel stimuli differing in F1 frequency, using the same subjects. Those with more acute F1 discrimination had compensated more to F1 perturbation. Experiment 3 consisted of simulations with the directions into velocities of articulators model of speech motor planning, which showed that the model can account for key aspects of compensation. In the model, movement goals for vowels are regions in auditory space; perturbation of auditory feedback invokes auditory feedback control mechanisms that correct for the perturbation, which in turn causes updating of feedforward commands to incorporate these corrections. The relation between speaker acuity and amount of compensation to auditory perturbation is mediated by the size of speakers' auditory goal regions, with more acute speakers having smaller goal regions. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.},

abstract={Humans can rapidly change their motor output to make goal-directed reaching movements in a new environment. Theories that describe this adaptive process have long presumed that adaptive steps scale proportionally with error. Here we show that while performing a novel reaching task, participants did not adopt a fixed learning rule, but instead modified their adaptive response based on the statistical properties of the movement environment. We found that as the directional bias of the force distribution shifted from strongly biased to unbiased, participants transitioned from an adaptive process that scaled proportionally with error to one that adapted to the direction, but not magnitude, of error. Participants also modified their response as the likelihood of the perturbation changed; as the likelihood decreased from 80 to 20% of trials, participants adopted an increasingly disproportional strategy. We propose that people can rapidly switch between learning processes within minutes of experiencing a novel environment. Copyright © 2007 The American Physiological Society.},

abstract={This study investigated how the brain can learn new temporal relationships between the predicted and actual consequences of a descending motor command. We chose a long and a short delay to assess cognitive and sensorimotor adaptation, respectively. Cognitive adaptation, in contrast to sensorimotor adaptation, would use higher cognitive mechanisms requiring attention and working memory associated with temporal processing. A horizontal cable, attached at pelvis level, was used to suspend a load that tended to move participants backwards. In experiment 1, the participants (n = 10) controlled unloading of the cable, which induced a forward destabilization. Three blocks of trials were performed. The first (PRE) and third (POST) blocks contained 30 trials each. For these conditions, the mechanical consequences of cable unloading were directly transmitted to the participants. The second block (DELAY) contained 60 trials. In this condition, a constant 600-ms delay was introduced between the motor action and the mechanical consequences of unloading. To determine whether the duration of the delay or the number of trials could explain the absence of prediction, we tested eight different participants (experiment 2). These participants first performed 15 imposed unloading trials (IMPOSED). In this condition, the experimenter controlled the onset of the unloading. Then, the participants were exposed to 120 self-triggered trials; the mechanical consequences of cable unloading were directly transmitted to the participants. Finally, four participants were exposed to a delay of 300 ms, whereas the other four were exposed to a delay of 600 ms. All the participants performed 120 delayed trials. Results of the first experiment revealed that when the participants controlled the timing of unloading and there was no delay, they activated their gastrocnemius (GM) muscle before unloading (120 ms and 126 ms for PRE and POST condition, respectively). When the unloading occurred 600 ms later, however, participants did not anticipate the unloading; their GM muscle onset followed the unloading. Across trials, however, they adapted their balance strategy as they decreased the activity of their tibialis anterior, and GM muscle onset occurred earlier than during imposed unloading. Nonetheless, overall participants succeeded in decreasing their peak center of mass velocity and center of mass and center of pressure ranges. Results from the second experiment showed that GM muscle onset occurred earlier than during imposed unloading for both delayed unloadings. Moreover, data for the shorter delay (i.e., 300 ms) showed that participants adapted their balance strategy response; their GM muscle onset occurred before the delayed unloading. Although, increasing the number of 600 ms delayed unloading (i.e., 60 to 120 trials) did not allow the brain to anticipate the unloading. In summary, the results of the present study suggest that the brain could adjust to some extent its balance control strategy when the temporal relationship between the motor action and its consequence was delayed. Nonetheless, cognitive adaptation would be limited compared to sensorimotor adaptation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In 4 studies, the authors tested the contributions of visual, kinesthetic, and verbal knowledge of results to the adaptive control of reaching movements toward visual targets. The same apparatus was used in all experiments, but the procedures differed in the sensory modality of the feedback that participants (Ns = 5, 5, 6, and 6, respectively, in Experiments 1, 2, 3, and 4) received about their performances. Using biased visual, proprioceptive, or verbal feedback, the authors introduced a 5° shift in the visuomanual relationship. Results showed no significant difference in the final amount of adaptation to the mismatch: On average, participants adapted to 79% of the perturbation. That finding is consistent with the view that adaptation is a multisensory, highly flexible process whose efficiency does not depend on the sensory channel conveying the error signal.

abstract={It has been shown before that sensorimotor adaptation to rotated vision is more generalized when subjects point at eight, rather than at four or less targets. Here we evaluate whether an even more variable practice has additional benefits. One group of subjects pointed at eight targets, and another group executed unconstrained arm movements throughout the workspace. We found no advantage of the latter group with respect to adaptive progress, persistence of adaptation without visual feedback, or transfer of adaptation to a new motor task. We therefore concluded that eight targets are sufficient to yield generalized adaptation. To determine the role of declarative knowledge for sensorimotor adaptation, subjects from both above groups were questioned regarding the nature of the distortion after they completed the experiment. We found that correct responders showed better adaptive progress, more persistence, but the same transfer as incorrect responders. We therefore concluded that the benefit of declarative knowledge is task-specific and short-lived, and is therefore probably related to strategic control rather than to an adaptive recalibration of the sensorimotor system. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={We have previously shown that viewing simulated rotary self-motion during treadmill locomotion causes immediate strategic modifications (Richards et al. in Presence Teleoper Vir Real 13:371-384, 2004) as well as an after effect reflecting adaptive modification of the control of position and trajectory during over-ground locomotion (Mulavara et al. in Exp Brain Res 166:210-219, 2005). The process of sensorimotor adaptation is comprised of both strategic and adaptive control mechanisms. Strategic control involves cognitive, on-line corrections to motor outputs once one is aware of a sensory discordance. Over an extended period of exposure to the sensory discordance, new strategic sensorimotor coordination patterns are reinforced until they become more automatic, and therefore adaptive in nature. The objective of this study was to investigate how strategic changes in trunk control during exposure to simulated rotary self-motion during treadmill walking influences adaptive modification of locomotor heading direction during over-ground stepping. Subjects (n = 10) walked on a motorized linear treadmill while viewing a wide field-of-view virtual scene for 24 min. The scene was static for the first 4 min and then, for the last 20 min, depicted constant rate self-motion equivalent to walking in a counter-clockwise, circular path around the perimeter of a room. Subjects performed five stepping trials both before and after the exposure period to assess after effects. Results from our previous study showed a significant change in heading direction (HD) during post-exposure step tests that was opposite to the direction in which the scene rotated during the adaptation period. For the present study, we quantified strategic modifications in trunk movement control during scene exposure using normalized root mean square (R P) variation of the subject's 3D trunk positions and normalized sum of standard deviations (R O) variation of 3D trunk orientations during scene rotation relative to that during static scene presentation. Associated 95% confidence intervals, CIP and CIO, were calculated to investigate the variation of strategic modifications during scene exposure. Repeated measures ANOVA and individual subject regression analyses showed that R P and R O (i.e. strategic modifications) for trunk fore/aft (X) positions and yaw rotations, respectively, decreased significantly over the exposure period. Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the magnitude change in HD and the rate at which the variation of strategic modifications in trunk X decreased. We also found evidence of a correlation between HD and the rate at which strategic modifications in trunk yaw decreased. We infer that adaptive recalibration of locomotor trajectory using optic flow stimuli depends on the rate at which kinematic variability associated with strategic control is reduced. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Studies investigating visuo-motor adaptation typically introduce sensory conflicts by manipulating visual information (prisms, cursor gains). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether similar adaptation would be observed when a conflict is created through distortion of the proprioceptive sense, rather than through visual distortion. We used a coordinated movement task that required participants to release thumb and index finger at a specific elbow angle during passive elbow extension. Participants could not see their arm, but were shown a cursor representing the forearm on a video screen. In the proprioceptive group, a sensory conflict was introduced by vibrating the biceps brachii muscle, introducing a discrepancy of approximately 7.5° between the proprioceptively perceived and visually perceived elbow angle. In the visual group, a conflict of similar magnitude was obtained by introducing a gain of 7.5° to the cursor with respect to forearm position. Adaptation was assessed by the presence of plastic changes in release elbow angles following a period of exposure to the sensory conflict (i.e., aftereffects). Both groups showed high accuracy during exposure despite the sensory conflicts. More importantly, the visual group presented large and persistent aftereffects, while the proprioceptive group presented none. We suggest that the proprioceptive group's lack of adaptation was due to the artificial muscle spindle activity resulting from vibration, which prevented visual and proprioceptive signals to be merged into a common frame of reference. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The ability of our sensorimotor system to adapt to changing and complex environmental demands has been under experimental scrutiny for more than a century. Previous works have shown that aimed arm movements adapt quickly and completely to Coriolis force, but incompletely to the combination of Coriolis and centrifugal forces without visual cues. Two hypotheses may be advanced to explain this discrepancy: the workspace-exploration hypothesis, and the degraded-proprioception hypothesis. The aim of this study was to distinguish between the above two alternatives by comparing adaptive improvement during off-axis rotation in subjects pointing at one, three or seven different targets in complete darkness. Two main results emerge: (a) off-axis rotation led initially to errors in the direction of Coriolis force and in the opposite direction of the centrifugal force; (b) the size of the visited workspace has no effect on the way the subjects adapt to a multi-force environment. The lack of a target-number effect and the persistence of lateral errors in the pointing movements performed during rotation of the platform, support the degraded-proprioception rather than the workspace-exploration hypothesis of adaptation to a multi-force environment. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation tasks can be classified into two types. When subjects adapt movements to visual feedback perturbations such as in prism lens adaptation, they perform kinematic adaptations. When subjects adapt movements to force field perturbations such as with robotic manipulanda, they perform kinetic adaptations. Neuroimaging studies have shown basal ganglia involvement in kinetic adaptations, but have found little evidence of basal ganglia involvement in kinematic adaptations, despite reports of deficits in patients with diseases of the basal ganglia, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, in these. In an effort to resolve such apparent discrepancy, we used FMRI to focus on the first few minutes of practice during kinematic adaptation. Human subjects adapted to visuomotor rotations in the context of a joystick aiming task while lying supine in a 3.0 T MRI scanner. As demonstrated previously, early adaptive processes were associated with BOLD activation in the cerebellum and the sensory and motor cortical regions. A novel finding of this study was bilateral basal ganglia activation. This suggests that, at least for early learning, the neural correlates of kinematic adaptation parallel those of other types of skill learning. We observed activation in the right globus pallidus and putamen, along with the right prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortex, which may support spatial cognitive processes of adaptation. We also observed activation in the left globus pallidus and caudate nucleus, along with the left premotor and supplementary motor cortex, which may support the sensorimotor processes of adaptation. These results are the first to demonstrate a clear involvement of basal ganglia activation in this type of kinematic motor adaptation. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Although many studies have documented declines in the ability of the elderly to learn new manual motor skills, studies have not directly compared the capacity of older adults to learn sequences versus adapt to sensorimotor perturbations within the context of the same task paradigm, despite differences in the underlying neural mechanisms and strategic processes supporting the two types of learning. The purpose of the current study was to exploit these task differences in an effort to determine whether aging results in a generalized or more specific skill learning deficit. Groups of young and older adult subjects learned to make a sequence of actions, adapted to one of two visuomotor rotations, or adapted to an altered gain of display, all while performing the same basic manual joystick aiming task. While the older adults exhibited normal sequence learning in comparison to the young adults, they exhibited impairments in all three of the adaptation tasks. These deficits in adaptation for the older adults were associated with hypometric movements and reduced velocity modulation in comparison to that seen in the younger adults. These data suggest that older adults may have greater difficulty with learning cerebellar-mediated motor skills. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Walking onto a stationary platform, which had been previously experienced as moving generates a locomotor aftereffect (LAE), which resembles the 'broken escalator' phenomenon. Experimentally, this is achieved by having subjects walk initially onto a stationary sled (BEFORE condition), then onto a moving sled (MOVING condition, or adaptation trials) and then again onto the stationary sled (AFTER condition). Subjects are always appropriately warned of the change in conditions. In this paper, we ask how many adaptation trials are needed to produce such a LAE. Thus, in two experiments, the number of MOVING trials was varied between 20 and 5 (Experiment 1) and between 8 and 1 (Experiment 2). Gait velocity, trunk position, foot contact timing and EMG of the ankle flexor-extensors muscles were measured. In comparison with BEFORE trials all groups in the AFTER trials walked inappropriately fast, experienced a large overshoot of the trunk and showed increased leg EMG, indicating that all groups showed a LAE. In each experiment, and for all variables, no significant difference between the groups (i.e. 20 down to one MOVING trials) was found. The study shows that this LAE, in contrast to other motor aftereffects reported in the literature, can be generated with only one or two adaptation trials and without requiring unexpected 'catch' trials. The fast aftereffect generation observed is likely to depend on two types of mechanisms: (1) the nature of the sensorimotor adaptation process, involving multiple sensory feedbacks (visual, vestibular and proprioceptive), anticipatory control and large initial task errors and (2) the involvement of two phylogenetically old neural mechanisms, namely locomotion and fear. Fear-relevant mechanisms, which are notably resistant to cognitive control, may be recruited during the adaptation trials and contribute to the release of this LAE. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={It is known that proprioceptive signals from muscles, joints, and skin are involved in the execution of aimed arm movements, but their role in the acquisition of new motor behaviour is largely unknown. Previous research using deafferented patients yielded inconsistent findings: sensorimotor adaptation was found to be less, equal, or even better than in controls. The present study uses a different approach: we degraded proprioceptive signals in healthy subjects by wrist vibration, while leaving them intact in a control group. In order to induce sensorimotor adaptation, both groups executed pointing movements under a visual (Exp. A) or a mechanical perturbation (Exp. B). We found that adaptation to the visual distortion was little affected by vibration, while adaptation to the mechanical distortion was substantially impaired. We conclude that proprioceptive signals which overtly disagree with visual ones (Exp. A) are not used for adaptation, while those which largely agree with visual ones (Exp. B) are used to enhance adaptive recalibration. These results indicate that intact proprioception is needed for mechanical but not for visual adaptation, which implies that the underlying mechanisms are at least partly distinct. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={For sensorimotor transformations to be executed accurately, there must be mechanisms that can both establish and modify mappings between sensory and motor coordinates. Such mechanisms were investigated in normal subjects using a reach-to-grasp task. First, we replaced the normal input of visual information about object size with auditory information, i.e., we attempted to establish an 'audiomotor map'. The size of the object was log linearly related to the frequency of the sound, and we measured the maximum grip aperture (MGA) during the reaching phase to determine if the subjects had learned the relationship. Second, we changed the frequency-object size relationship to study adaptation in the newly acquired map. Our results demonstrate that learning of an audiomotor map consisted of three distinct phases: during the first stage (∼10-15 trials) subjects simply used MGAs large enough to grasp any reasonably sized object and there were no overt signs of learning. During the second stage, there was a period of fast learning where the slope of the relationship between MGA and object size became steeper until the third stage where the slope was constant. In contrast, when sensorimotor adaptation was studied in the established audiomotor map, there was rapid learning from the start of a size perturbation. We conclude that different learning strategies are employed when sensorimotor transformations are established compared to when existing transformations are modified. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anatomic substrates underlying the beneficial effect of prism adaptation in five patients with persistent left neglect following right stroke. METHODS: In a functional imaging PET study, we used a covariation analysis to examine linear changes of regional cerebral blood flow over sessions as a function of left neglect improvement. RESULTS: The network of significant brain regions associated with improvement of left neglect performance produced by prism adaptation involved the right cerebellum, the left thalamus, the left temporo-occipital cortex, the left medial temporal cortex, and the right posterior parietal cortex. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the realignment of visuomotor coordinates is processed by the cerebellum and that low level sensorimotor adaptation actively modulates cerebral areas, albeit now relying on intact cerebellocerebral connections. Hence, our data support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of prism adaptation on the clinical presentation of left neglect derives from modulation of cortical regions implicated in spatial cognition.

abstract={When learning a novel motor task, the sensorimotor system must develop new strategies to efficiently control the limb(s) involved, and this adaptation appears to be developed through the construction of a behavioral map known as an 'internal model'. A common method to uncover the mechanisms of adaptation and reorganization processes is to expose the system to new environmental conditions, typically by introducing visual or mechanical distortions. The present study investigated the adaptation mechanisms of the human sensorimotor system to horizontal and vertical mirror distortions (HMD and VMD) during the execution of fast goal-directed arm movements. Mirror distortions (MDs) were created by means of virtual visual feedback on a computer screen while the movement was executed on a graphics tablet. Twenty healthy adult participants were recruited and assigned to one of two groups of 10 people each. Tests were divided in two subsequent blocks of five trials. The first block consisted of trials with no mirror distortion (NMD), while the second block was recorded when exposing one group to HMD and the other to VMD. Both MDs resulted in kinematic changes: during the tests with the MDs the participants did not reach the performance level found at the NMD test. Motor performance during HMD appeared to be globally better than during VMD and the adaptation process to VMD appeared to be slower than to HMD, but data interpretation was hampered by large within-participant and between-participant variability. In-depth analyses of the data revealed that most of the motor performance information was contained in the direction of movement. The data supported the idea that the internal model for HMD was already partially built. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Purpose. The purpose of this study was to investigate short-term adaptation to vertical yoked prisms in visually normal subjects as well as to develop normative data for future comparative purposes in patients with acquired brain injury. Methods. A full-body enclosure containing a calibrated laser pointer was used to assess egocentric localization (i.e., one's perceived sense of "straight ahead") in total darkness. Fourteen visually normal subjects were tested in a counterbalanced manner under both experimental (20 pd base-down) and control (plano or zero power) test conditions with each test condition lasting 1 hour. A rating scale questionnaire was also administered to assess quantitatively subjective adaptation to the yoked prisms. Results. Group mean egocentric localization showed approximately 50% adaptation during the 1-hour test period. Subjective adaptation results were similar. Conclusion. The findings suggest that rapid perceptually driven, sensorimotor adaptation occurred as assessed both objectively and subjectively in response to vertical yoked prisms. These results are similar to those found in other experiments involving short-term adaptation to optical rearrangements. Copyright © 2006 American Academy of Optometry.},

abstract={A number of different sites in the human brain have been shown to play a role in sensorimotor adaptation. However, the specific role played by each of these structures in the learning process is poorly understood. In the present study, the contribution of the dorsal aspect of the premotor cortex was examined by disrupting activity at this site using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while subjects wearing prism goggles pointed at visual targets. This manipulation slowed down the rate of adaptation when vision of the hand was available throughout the movement and reduced the presence of on-line trajectory corrections. This was accompanied by a reduced shift in the felt position of the arm. In contrast, TMS did not cause any alteration in the performance of this task when vision of the hand was available only at the end of the movement. Thus, we infer from this pattern of results that the human dorsal premotor cortex contributes to the generation of the visually based on-line error corrections that are responsible for the remapping of arm position sense underlying sensorimotor adaptation.

abstract={We investigated whether deficits of adaptive improvement in seniors are related to an age-dependent decay of the brain's executive functions. Younger and older subjects completed a battery of cognitive tests, and preformed aimed arm movements before and during exposure to rotated visual feedback. In accordance with previous work, we found that adaptive improvement during exposure was degraded in seniors, while the transfer of adaptation to a new motor task was not. This pattern of findings confirms that strategic control but not sensorimotor recalibration is affected by old age. Using multiple linear regression (MLR) to extract separate executive components from our test battery, we found that basic response speed and decision-making, but not the inhibition of prepotent responses or mental flexibility, were degraded in our older subjects. Again using MLR, we found that degraded adaptive improvement in our seniors was partly related to the decay of basic response speed and decision-making, and partly to age-dependent phenomena not addressed by our cognitive-test battery. Finally, we observed that interindividual variability of cognition and adaptive improvement was larger in old than in young subjects, which could explain why some previous studies found degraded adaptation in seniorswhile others did not. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Sensorimotor adaptation can be defined as perceptural adaptation whose effects depend on the occurrence and nature of the performed motor actions. Examples of sensorimotor adaptation can be found in the literature on prisms concerning several space-related attributes like orientation, curvature, and size. In this article, we show that sensorimotor adaptation can be obtained for color, as a consequence of the introduction of a new sensorimptor contingency between eye movements and color changes. In an adaptation phase, trials involved the successive presentation of two patches, first on the left, and then on the right or the opposite. The left patch being always red and the right patch green, a correlation is introduced between left-right (respectively right-left) eye saccades and red-green (respectively green-red) color change. After 40 min of adaptation, when two yellow patches are successively presented on each side of the screen, the chromaticity of the left and right, patches need respectively to be shifted toward the chromaticity of the red and green adaptation patches for subjective equality to be obtained. When the eyes are kept fixed during the adaptation stage, creating a strong nonhomogeneity in retinal adaptation, no effect is found. This ensures that, if present, adaptation at a given retinal location cannot explain the present effect. A third experiment shows a dependency of the effect on the eyes'saccadic movements and not on the position on the screen, that is, on the position of the eyes in the orbits. These results argue for the involvement of sensorimotor mechanisms in color perception. The relation of these experimental findings toward a sensorimotor theory of color perception is discussed. © 2006 ARVO.},

abstract={Extensive work on learning in reaching and pointing tasks has demonstrated high degrees of plasticity in our ability to optimize goal-directed motor behavior. However, studies focusing on the perceptual awareness of our own actions during motor adaptation are still rare. Here we present the first simultaneous investigation of sensorimotor adaptation on both levels, i.e., action and action perception. We hypothesized that self-action perception relies on internal predictions about the sensory action outcome that are updated in a way similar to that of motor control. Twenty human subjects performed out-and-back pointing movements that were fed back visually. Feedback was initially presented in spatiotemporal correspondence with respect to the actual finger position, but later rotated by a constant angle. When distorted feedback was applied repetitively, subjects' perceived pointing direction shifted in the direction of the trajectory rotation. A comparable perceptual reinterpretation was observed in control trials without visual feedback, indicating that subjects learned to predict the new visual outcome of their actions based on nonvisual, internal information. The perception of the world, however, remained unchanged. The changes in perception of one's own movements were accompanied by adaptive changes in motor performance of the same amount, i.e., a secondary motor compensation opposite to the direction of the imposed visual rotation. Our results show that the perception of one's own actions depends on adaptable internal predictions about the sensory action outcome, allowing us to attribute new sensory consequences of our actions to our own agency. Furthermore, they indicate that the updated sensory prediction can be used to optimize motor control. Copyright © 2006 The American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Acquisition and retention of sensorimotor skills have been extensively investigated psychophysically, but little is known about the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Here we examine the evolution of neural activity associated with adaptation to new kinematic tasks in two cortical areas: the caudal supplementary motor area (SMA proper), and the primary motor cortex (MI). We investigate the hypothesis that adaptation starts at premotor areas, i.e., higher in the hierarchy of computation, until a stable representation is formed in primary areas. In accordance with previous studies, we found that adaptation can be characterized by two phases: an early phase that is accompanied by fast and substantial reduction of errors, followed by a late phase with slower and more moderate improvements in behavior. We used unsupervised clustering to separate the activity of the single cells into groups of cells with similar response patterns, under the assumption that each such subpopulation forms a functional unit. We specifically observed the number of clusters in each cortical area during early and late phases of the adaptation and found that the number of clusters is higher in the SMA during early phases of adaptation. In contrast, a higher number of clusters was observed in MI only during late phases. Our results suggest a new approach to analyze responses of large populations of neurons and use it to show a hierarchy of dynamic reorganization of functional groups during adaptation.

abstract={Recent studies report efficient vestibular control of goal-directed arm movements during body motion. This contribution tested whether this control relies (a) on an updating process in which vestibular signals are used to update the perceived egocentric position of surrounding objects when body orientation changes, or (b) on a sensorimotor process, i.e. a transfer function between vestibular input and the arm motor output that preserves hand trajectory in space despite body rotation. Both processes were separately and specifically adapted. We then compared the respective influences of the adapted processes on the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements. The rationale was that if a given process underlies a given behavior, any adaptive modification of this process should give rise to observable modification of the behavior. The updating adaptation adapted the matching between vestibular input and perceived body displacement in the surrounding world. The sensorimotor adaptation adapted the matching between vestibular input and the arm motor output necessary to keep the hand fixed in space during body rotation. Only the sensorimotor adaptation significantly altered the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements. Our results therefore suggest that during passive self-motion, the vestibular control of arm-reaching movements essentially derives from a sensorimotor process by which arm motor output is modified on-line to preserve hand trajectory in space despite body displacement. In contrast, the updating process maintaining up-to-date the egocentric representation of visual space seems to contribute little to generating the required arm compensation during body rotations. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={We have studied the effect of rest breaks on sensorimotor adaptation to rotated visual feedback in a pointing task. Adaptive improvement was significantly poorer after 1-s breaks than after 5-40-s breaks, with no significant difference among the latter break durations. The benefit of >1-s breaks emerged soon after the onset of adaptation, and then remained steady throughout the adaptation, retention (next day), and persistence (no feedback) phases. This pattern of findings indicates that break-induced facilitation is not a result of strategic adjustments, motivation, or recovery from fatigue, but rather to consolidation of previously acquired sensorimotor recalibration rules. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={We tested between three levels of visuospatial adaptation (global map, parallel feature modules, and parallel sensorimotor transformations) by training subjects to reach and grasp virtual objects viewed through a left-right reversing prism, with either visual location or orientation feedback. Even though spatial information about the global left-right reversal was present in every training session, subjects trained with location feedback reached to the correct location but with the wrong (reversed) grasp orientation. Subjects trained with orientation feedback showed the opposite pattern. These errors were task-specific and not feature-specific; subjects trained to correctly grasp visually reversed-oriented bars failed to show knowledge of the reversal when asked to point to the end locations of these bars. These results show that adaptation to visuospatial distortion-even global reversals-is implemented through learning rules that operate on parallel sensorimotor transformations (e.g., reach vs. grasp).},

abstract={Visuomotor adaptive processes were examined by testing transfer of adaptation between similar conditions. Participants made manual aiming movements with a joystick to hit targets on a computer screen, with real-time feedback display of their movement. They adapted to three different rotations of the display in a sequential fashion, with a return to baseline display conditions between rotations. Adaptation was better when participants had prior adaptive experiences. When performance was assessed using direction error (calculated at the time of peak velocity) and initial endpoint error (error before any overt corrective actions), transfer was greater when the final rotation reflected an addition of previously experienced rotations (adaptation order 30° rotation, 15°, 45°) than when it was a subtraction of previously experienced conditions (adaptation order 45° rotation, 15°, 30°). Transfer was equal regardless of adaptation order when performance was assessed with final endpoint error (error following any discrete, corrective actions). These results imply the existence of multiple independent processes in visuomotor adaptation. © 2005 Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={This study examined the effect of transformed visual feedback on movement control in Huntington's disease (HD). Patients in the early stages of HD and controls performed aiming movements towards peripheral targets on a digitizing tablet and emphasizing precision. In a baseline condition, HD patients were slower but showed few precision problems in aiming. When visual feedback was inverted in both vertical and horizontal axes, patients showed problems in initial and terminal phases of movement where feedback is most critical. When visual feedback was inverted along a single axis as in a mirror-inversion, HD patients showed large deviations and over-corrections before adaptation. Adaptation was similar in both groups. These results suggest that HD impairs on-line error correction in novel movements. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Previous studies have found that sensorimotor adaptation to visual distortions is degraded in seniors compared with younger subjects, whereas after-effects on removal of the distortion are age-independent. The latter finding was interpreted as evidence that adaptive recalibration is not affected by old age, and that the observed degradation is therefore due to impairment of strategic control. However, after-effects are not a reliable measure of recalibration, because they can be artificially inflated by perseveration, a characteristic symptom in old age. The present work therefore introduces a test of recalibration which is insensitive to perseveration. Twelve young and twelve old subjects executed center-out pointing movements while visual feedback about their fingertip was either veridical (baseline), 60-deg rotated (adaptation), or absent (after-effect).They also executed tracking movements toward an unpredictably moving object before and after the pointing task. Seniors adapted less than younger subjects but their after-effects were not degraded. More importantly, transfer of adaptation from a pointing to a tracking task was not degraded in seniors. The latter outcome documents, in a more compelling fashion than previous work, that recalibration in the elderly is not impaired, and that the observed deficit of adaptation is therefore most probably because of impaired strategic control. This conclusion is supported by two additional findings: compared with young subjects our seniors performed less well on a cognitive screening test and acquired no explicit knowledge about the nature of the imposed visual distortion. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract={An influential idea in human motor learning is that there is a consolidation period during which motor memories are transformed from a fragile to a permanent state, no longer susceptible to interference from new learning. The evidence supporting this idea comes from studies showing that the motor memory of a task (A) is lost when an opposing task (B) is experienced soon after, but not if sufficient time is allowed to pass (∼6 hr). We report results from three laboratories challenging this consolidation idea. We used an ABA paradigm in the context of a reaching task to assess the influence of experiencing B after A on the retention of A. In two experiments using visuomotor rotations, we found that B fully interferes with the retention of A even when B is experienced 24 hr after A. Contrary to previous reports, in four experiments on learning force fields, we also observed full interference between A and B when they are separated by 24 hr or even 1 week. This latter result holds for both position-dependent and velocity-dependent force fields. For both the visuomotor and force-field tasks, complete interference is still observed when the possible affects of anterograde interference are controlled through the use of washout trials. Our results fail to support the idea that motor memories become consolidated into a protected state. Rather, they are consistent with recent ideas of memory formation, which propose that memories can shift between active and inactive states.},

abstract={The sensorimotor transformations necessary for generating appropriate motor commands depend on both current and previously acquired sensory information. To investigate the relative impact (or weighting) of visual and haptic information about object size during grasping movements, we let normal subjects perform a task in which, unbeknownst to the subjects, the object seen (visual object) and the object grasped (haptic object) were never the same physically. When the haptic object abruptly became larger or smaller than the visual object, subjects in the following trials automatically adapted their maximum grip aperture when reaching for the object. This adaptation was not dependent on conscious processes. We analyzed how visual and haptic information were weighted during the course of sensorimotor adaptation. The adaptation process was quicker and relied more on haptic information when the haptic objects increased in size than when they decreased in size. As such, sensory weighting seemed to be molded to avoid prehension error. We conclude from these results that the impact of a specific source of sensory information on the sensorimotor transformation is regulated to satisfy task requirements.},

abstract={Objective: To examine the sensorimotor adaptive response of a 77-year-old man exposed to the gravito-inertial challenges of orbital space flight. Study Design: Prospective case study with retrospective comparisons. Setting: NASA Neurosciences Laboratory (Johnson Space Center) and Baseline Data Collection Facility (Kennedy Space Center). Primary Participant: One 77-year-old male shuttle astronaut. Intervention: Insertion into low Earth orbit was used to remove gravitational stimuli and thereby trigger sensorimotor adaptation to the microgravity environment. Graviceptor stimulation was reintroduced at landing, and sensorimotor readaptation to the terrestrial environment was tracked to completion. Main Outcome Measures: Computerized dynamic posturography tests were administered before and after orbital flight to determine the magnitude and time course of recovery. Results: The elderly astronaut exhibited balance control performance decrements on landing day; however, there were no significant differences between his performance and that of younger astronauts tested on the same shuttle mission or on previous shuttle missions of similar duration. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the physiological changes attributed to aging do not necessarily impair adaptive sensorimotor control processes.},

abstract={Introduction: Previous research suggests that human sensorimotor performance depends both on task difficulty, and on the allocation of the brain's computational resources to the task. We employ this view to analyze the changes of sensorimotor performance during the microgravity episodes of parabolic flight. Methods: There were seven subjects who participated before, during, and after exposure to the microgravity episodes of parabolic flight. They performed a tracking task with one hand, and a four-choice reaction time task with the other hand, either alone or concurrently. Overall performance scores across tasks were calculated. Results: Overall single-task performance deteriorated by about 50% in microgravity, with little sign of recovery during the flight. Overall dual-task interference was more than twice as great at the onset of microgravity than at the onset of the 1-G baseline, but converged toward that baseline within about 4.5 min. Conclusions: Our subjects accepted a consistently poor level of sensorimotor performance throughout exposure to microgravity. To maintain that level, they increased the allocation of computational resources to the tasks at the onset of microgravity, but an increase was no longer necessary after 4.5 min of microgravity exposure. We take the initial increase as evidence of a brief phase of sensorimotor adaptation.},

abstract={We investigated the mechanisms of sensorimotor adaptation by sequentially exposing human subjects to different visual distortions. Subjects performed a manual tracking task, while the relationship between their actual finger movement and its visual feedback was manipulated either by a position-to-position (PP), or by a position-to-velocity (PV) transformation. The outcome confirmed previous findings, in that adaptation to PP facilitated the subsequent adaptation to a second, additional PP. More importantly, our present data documented that pre-exposure to PP interferes with the subsequent adaptation to PV, and vice versa. Thus, we observed anterograde interference between two transformations of common physical nature (i.e., visual), but different kinematic coupling. When previous work on sequential adaptation to visual and mechanical transformations is reconsidered in light of this finding, converging evidence is yielded in favor of a distributed adaptive mechanism, where the magnitude of interference between two successive adaptation sessions depends on the overlap of the involved neural structures.},

abstract={It is well known that sensorimotor adaptation will transfer from the practiced to the unpracticed arm, which has been taken as evidence that adaptation is located in the brain before the divergence point for left and right arm control. We now explore whether adaptation will transfer between different movement categories as well. Subjects were exposed to a 60-deg visual rotation first in a tracking and then in a pointing task, or vice versa. We found a substantial transfer of adaptation between tasks, but its magnitude was larger from pointing to tracking than from tracking to pointing. This benefit of pointing persisted when the use of cognitive strategies was minimized by a concurrent, attention-demanding task, but it was lost when pointing amplitudes were very small. We conclude that adaptation is located in the brain before the divergence point for different movement categories, and that movements with a large ballistic component facilitate adaptation transfer.},

abstract={As a countermeasure to the debilitating physiological effects of weightlessness, astronauts could live continuously in an artificial gravity environment created by slow rotation of an entire spacecraft or be exposed to brief daily "doses" in a short radius centrifuge housed within a non-rotating spacecraft. A potential drawback to both approaches is that head movements made during rotation may be disorienting and nauseogenic. These side effects are more severe at higher rotation rates, especially upon first exposure. Head movements during rotation generate aberrant vestibular stimulation and Coriolis force perturbations of the head-neck motor system. This article reviews our progress toward distinguishing vestibular and motor factors in side effects of rotation, and presents new data concerning the rates of rotation up to which adaptation is possible. We have studied subjects pointing to targets during constant velocity rotation, because these movements generate Coriolis motor perturbations of the arm but do not involve unusual vestibular stimulation. Initially, reaching paths and endpoints are deviated in the direction of the transient lateral Coriolis forces generated. With practice, subjects soon move in straighter paths and land on target once more. If sight of the arm is permitted, adaptation is more rapid than in darkness. Initial arm movement trajectory and endpoint deviations are proportional to Coriolis force magnitude over a range of rotation speeds from 5 to 20 rpm, and there is rapid, complete motor adaptation at all speeds. These new results indicate that motor adaptation to high rotation rates is possible. Coriolis force perturbations of head movements also occur in a rotating environment but adaptation gradually develops over the course of many head movements.},

abstract={After sustained stepping in-place on a rotating disc, healthy subjects will inadvertently turn in circles when asked to step in-place on a stationary surface with eyes closed. We asked whether the cerebellum is important for this adaptive phenomenon, called podokinetic after-rotation (PKAR). Subjects with cerebellar degeneration and age-matched control subjects performed 15 min of stepping in-place with eyes open on a rotating disc, then 30 min of attempting to step in-place with eyes closed on a stationary surface. Rotational velocity of PKAR was measured during this 30-min period. All control subjects demonstrated PKAR; average initial rotational velocity for control subjects was 16.4±3.5°/s. Five of the eight cerebellar subjects demonstrated impaired PK adaptation, defined as PKAR with an initial velocity more than two standard deviations below the control mean initial velocity. Average initial rotational velocity for cerebellar subjects was 7.8±0.2°/s. Impaired PK adaptation was not associated with impaired time constants of decay and was not correlated with variability of PKAR velocity. Our results suggest that the cerebellum is important for regulation of the amplitude of PK adaptation and that reduced PKAR amplitude is not likely the result of dyscoordination or variability of movement in the subjects tested.},

abstract={For 1 week, healthy human participants (n=7) were devoid of normal vision by exposure to prism lenses that optically rotated their perceived world around the line of sight by 180°. Adaptation to such prisms involved sustained and vigorous practice of the ability to redirect the unadapted efferent motor command; because prior to all visually guided movements, the to-be-executed efferent command was based on incorrect (prismatically reversed) spatial information. The time course of this sort of adaptation was systematically explored in Cooper-Shepard mental rotation (MR) tests and in naturalistic motor-tasks for the purpose of investigating whether mental rotations of the direction of the intended movement share common aspects with the process of MR. A control group (n=7) intermittently exposed to the distorted spatial organization of the central visual field was studied in parallel. The main results were as follows: (a) the MR reaction times (RTs) day 1 with prisms appeared to be very similar to the normal RTs (day 1, no-prisms) with the one exception that subjects now responded within a prism (rotated) frame of spatial reference rather than within the environmentally upright. The visuomotor performance became grossly irregular and dysmetric. (b) The majority of the visuomotor adaptation functions began to level off on the 3rd day. (c) The increases in natural motor proficiency were accompanied by a systematic and noticeable decrease in magnitude of the MR Y-intercept obtained from the linear regression line calculated between each subject's RT and the various stimulus angles. MR slopes were stable through days 1-7 for both the experimental and control group. An increased correlation between rotational stimulus angle and RT suggested that the MR function also became progressively more tightly coupled to the stimulus angles. (d) Postadaptation measures of performance indicated the occurrence of selective and minimal adaptation in the natural motor tasks only. It is suggested that these results reflect an improved attentional (strategic) ability to replace incorrect (error producing) control signals with correct (error reducing) control signals. As a result, perceptual-motor start-up processes directly related to spatial coding and to the planning, initiation and correction of the intended direction of motor-or-mental movement improved while the subprocess ("stage") concerned with transformations of such movements remained unchanged. Visuomotor adaptation to inverting prisms engages, and thereby stimulates, a cortical system also invoked in the preparatory process of MR.},

abstract={Perception and action are based on information from multiple sensory modalities. For instance, both vision and proprioception provide information about hand position, and this information is integrated to generate a single estimate of where the hand is in space. Classically, vision has been thought to dominate this process, with the estimate of hand position relying more on vision than on proprioception [1]. However, an optimal integration model [2] that takes into account the precision of vision and proprioception predicts that the weighting of the two senses varies with direction and that the classical result should only hold for specific spatial directions. Using an adaptation paradigm, we show that, as predicted by this model, the visual-proprioceptive integration varies with direction. Variation with direction was so strong that, in the depth direction, the classical result was reversed: the estimate relies more on proprioception than on vision. These results provide evidence for statistically optimal integration of information from multiple modalities.},

abstract={When humans perform goal-directed arm movements under the influence of an external damping force, they learn to adapt to these external dynamics. After removal of the external force field, they reveal kinematic aftereffects that are indicative of a neural controller that still compensates the no longer existing force. Such behavior suggests that the adult human nervous system uses a neural representation of inverse arm dynamics to control upper-extremity motion. Central to the notion of an inverse dynamic model (IDM) is that learning generalizes. Consequently, aftereffects should be observable even in untrained workspace regions. Adults have shown such behavior, but the ontogenetic development of this process remains unclear. This study examines the adaptive behavior of children and investigates whether learning a force field in one hemifield of the right arm work-space has an effect on force adaptation in the other hemifield. Thirty children (aged 6-10 years) and ten adults performed 30° elbow flexion movements under two conditions of external damping (negative and null). We found that learning to compensate an external damping force transferred to the opposite hemifield, which indicates that a model of the limb dynamics rather than an association of visited space and experienced force was acquired. Aftereffects were more pronounced in the younger children and readaptation to a null-force condition was prolonged. This finding is consistent with the view that IDMs in children are imprecise neural representations of the actual arm dynamics. It indicates that the acquisition of IDMs is a developmental achievement and that the human motor system is inherently flexible enough to adapt to any novel force within the limits of the organism's biomechanics.},

abstract={Normal aging is associated with declines in neurologic function. Uncompensated visual and vestibular problems may have dire consequences including dangerous falls. Visuo-motor plasticity is a form of behavioral neural plasticity, which is important in the process of adapting to visual or vestibular alteration, including those changes due to pathology, pharmacotherapy, surgery or even entry into microgravity or an underwater environment. To determine the effects of aging on visuo-motor plasticity, we chose the simple and easily measured paradigm of visual-motor rearrangement created by using visual displacement prisms while throwing small balls at a target. Subjects threw balls before, during and after wearing a set of prisms which displace the visual scene by twenty degrees to the right. Data obtained during adaptation were modeled using multilevel modeling techniques for 73 subjects, aged 20 to 80 years. We found no statistically significant difference in measures of visuo-motor plasticity with advancing age. Further studies are underway examining variable practice training as a potential mechanism for enhancing this form of behavioral neural plasticity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Our brain's capacity for adaptation allows us to interact meaningfully with an ever-changing environment. Experimental evidence suggests that the time course of sensorimotor adaptation is preserved or only moderately degraded in old age, and that seniors benefit from a previous adaptive experience even more than younger subjects. However, experimental evidence suggests that sensorimotor adaptation seems to be associated with a higher computational load in the elderly. We discuss two possible explanations for this pattern of findings: Older adults may take longer to consolidate newly gained information into long-term motor memory, or they may have problems to utilize supplementary (e.g. cognitive) strategies. In any case, the age-related deficits were relatively mild. If these deficits are related to an increased computational load, it should be possible to reduce them by extended practice on adaptation tasks. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={When motor actions (e.g., reaching with your hand) adapt to altered sensory feedback (e.g., viewing a shifted image of your hand through a prism), the phenomenon is called sensorimotor adaptation (SA). In the study reported here, SA was observed in speech. In two 2-hour experiments (adaptation and control), participants whispered a variety of CVC words. For those words containing the vowel /ε/, participants heard auditory feedback of their whispering. A DSP-based vocoder processed the participants' auditory feedback in real time, allowing the formant frequencies of participants' auditory speech feedback to be shifted. In the adaptation experiment, formants were shifted along one edge of the vowel triangle. For half the participants, formants were shifted so participants heard /a/ when they produced /ε/; for the other half, the shift made participants hear /i/ when they produced /ε/. During the adaptation experiment, participants altered their production of /ε/ to compensate for the altered feedback, and these production changes were retained when participants whispered with auditory feedback blocked by masking noise. In a control experiment, in which the formants were not shifted, participants' production changes were small and inconsistent. Participants exhibited a range of adaptations in response to the altered feedback, with some participants adapting almost completely, and other participants showing very little or no adaptation.},

abstract={Motor function is altered by microgravity, but little detail is available as to what these changes are and how changes in the individual components of the sensorimotor system affect the control of movement. Further, there is little information on whether the changes in motor performance reflect immediate or chronic adaptations to changing gravitational environments. To determine the effects of microgravity on the neural control properties of selected motor pools, four male astronauts from the NASA STS-78 mission performed motor tasks requiring the maintenance of either ankle dorsiflexor or plantarflexor torque. Torques of 10 or 50% of a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) were requested of the subjects during 10° peak-to-peak sinusoidal movements at 0.5 Hz. When 10% MVC of the plantarflexors was requested, the actual torques generated in-flight were similar to pre-flight values. Post-flight torques were higher than pre- and in-flight torques. The actual torques when 50% MVC was requested were higher in- and post-flight than pre-flight. Soleus (Sol) electromyographic (EMG) amplitudes during plantarflexion were higher in-flight than pre- or post-flight for both the 10 and 50% MVC tasks. No differences in medial gastrocnemius (MG) EMG amplitudes were observed for either the 10 or 50% MVC tasks. The EMG amplitudes of the tibialis anterior (TA), an antagonist to plantarflexion, were higher in- and post-flight than pre-flight for the 50% MVC task. During the dorsiflexion tasks, the torques generated in both the 10 and 50% MVC tasks did not differ pre-, in- and post-flight. TA EMG amplitudes were significantly higher in- than pre-flight for both the 10 or 50% MVC tasks, and remained elevated post-flight for the 50% MVC test. Both the Sol and MG EMG amplitudes were significantly higher in-flight than either pre- or post-flight for both the 10 and 50% MVC tests. These data suggest that the most consistent response to space flight was an elevation in the level of contractions of agonists and antagonists when attempting to maintain constant torques at a given level of MVC. Also, the chronic levels of EMG activity in selected ankle flexor and extensor muscles during space flight and during routine activities on Earth were recorded. Compared with pre- and post-flight values, there was a marked increase in the total EMG activity of the TA and the Sol and no change in the MG EMG activity in-flight. These data indicate that space flight, as occurs on shuttle missions, is a model of elevated activation of both flexor and extensor muscles, probably reflecting the effects of programmed work schedules in flight rather than a direct effect of microgravity.},

abstract={The present study investigates if sensorimotor adaptation to large visual rotations is achieved by a continuous angular change of the internal representation of space. Human subjects performed manual tracking movements under rotated visual feedback in two sessions; the magnitude of rotation in the second session was 45° larger or smaller than in the first. We found mostly a facilitatory effect of the first adaptation on the second, which supports the view that the internal representation can gradually shift from one angular transformation to another. However, no facilitation was found for visual rotations in the 80-120° range, suggesting that the internal model changes gradually only up to a limiting angle. A subsidiary experiment, employing small stepwise changes of visual rotation throughout a testing session, confirmed this view and placed the limiting angle near 120° for an increasing, and near 70° for a decreasing visual rotation. We conclude that adaptation to large-magnitude rotations may be achieved in two stages: a polarity inversion of both axes (=180° rotation), followed by a "backward" shift toward somewhat smaller angles.},

abstract={Using the multiple-exposure approach, we investigated sensorimotor adaptation by exposing human subjects to different angles of visual rotation in a tracking task. Generally, the tracking error was high at the onset of the visual rotation and gradually declined towards the baseline level during the exposure period. In experiment A, we confirmed that the initial tracking error increases more than proportionally with the angle of rotation. In experiment C, we were unable to confirm inter-manual transfer, and attribute this discrepancy with previous literature to details of the experimental tasks. In our main experiment, B, we found that pre-exposure to 45° or 60° of visual rotation facilitated the subsequent adaptation to a 90° rotation, with the facilitatory effect being more pronounced following the 60° rotation. We interpret this finding as evidence that adaptation is achieved by a gradual process, which progresses from small angles of output transformation through intermediate values up to the prescribed angle of rotation.},

abstract={We investigated how sensorimotor adaptation acquired during one experimental session influenced the adaptation in a subsequent session. The subjects' task was to track a visual target using a joystick-controlled cursor, while the relationship between joystick and cursor position was manipulated to introduce a sensorimotor discordance. Each subject participated in two sessions, separated by a pause of 2 min to 1 month duration. We found that adaptation was achieved within minutes, and persisted in the memory for at least a month, with only a small decay (experiment A). When the discordances administered in the two sessions were in mutual conflict, we found evidence for task interference (experiment B). However, when the discordances were independent, we found facilitation rather than interference (experiment C); the latter finding could not be explained by the use of an "easier" discordance in the second session (experiment D). We conclude that interference is due to an incompatibility between task requirements, and not to a competition of tasks for short-term memory. We further conclude that the ability to adapt to a sensorimotor discordance can be improved by practicing with an unrelated discordance.},

abstract={Most events are processed by a number of neural pathways. These pathways often differ considerably in processing speed. Thus, coherent perception requires some form of synchronization mechanism. Moreover, this mechanism must be flexible, because neural processing speed changes over the life of an organism. Here we provide behavioral evidence that humans can adapt to a new intersensory temporal relationship (which was artificially produced by delaying visual feedback). The conflict between these results and previous work that failed to find such improvements can be explained by considering the present results as a form of sensorimotor adaptation.},

abstract={Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in," visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

abstract={The adaptation of dynamic movement-posture coordination during forward trunk bending was investigated in long-term weightlessness. Three-dimensional movement analysis was carried out in two astronauts during a 4-mo microgravity exposure. The principal component analysis was applied to joint-angle kinematics for the assessment of angular synergies. The anteroposterior center of mass (CM) displacement accompanying trunk flexion was also quantified. The results reveal that subjects kept typically terrestrial strategies of movement-posture coordination. The temporary disruption of joint-angular synergies observed at subjects' first in-flight session was promptly recovered when repetitive sessions in flight were analyzed. The CM anteroposterior shift was consistently <3-4 cm, suggesting that subjects could dynamically control the CM position throughout the whole flight. This is in contrast to the observed profound microgravity-induced disruption of the quasi-static body orientation and initial CM positioning. Although this study was based on only two subjects, evidence is provided that static and dynamic postural control might be under two separate mechanisms, adapting with their specific time course to the constraints of microgravity.},

abstract={Basic neural processes of sensorimotor adaptation can be observed by cellular-level studies on cerebellar cortex, both by electrophysiological and morphological means. In earlier studies we demonstrated double (sometimes triple or quadruple) rhythmic prespike activity patterns in dendritic microelectrode records taken from cerebellar Pc. By their active and passive interactions, the actual input pattern will turn into an arrhythmic output spiking, realizing a nonlinear and phase-sensitive integration. This curious complex spike-generating process can give rise to novel cerebellar functional models. The acting membrane dynamics rely not just upon the ionic current machinery but also upon the specific micromorphology of the dendritic tree, especially that of the branching areas. Although, statistical analyses on Pc dendrites generally followed the graph-theory, elaborated abstract parameters for complexity and hierarchy, and denied realistic geometry. Thus a novel specific morphometric study should be carried out, first applied to the main branching sites.},

abstract={When we move grasped objects, our grip force precisely anticipates gravitational and inertial loads. We analysed the control of grip forces during very substantial load changes induced by parabolic flights. During these flight manoeuvres, the gravity varies between hypergravity associated with a doubling of normal terrestrial gravity and a 20-s period of microgravity. Accordingly, the contribution of the object's weight to the load changed from being twice the normal value to being absent. Two subjects continuously performed vertical and horizontal movements of an object equipped with grip force and acceleration sensors. Whereas, during vertical movements performed under normal and hypergravity, a load force maximum occurred at the lower turning point and a minimum at the upper turning point, the load force pattern was completely changed under microgravity. In particular, the upper turning point was also associated with a load force maximum. Analysis of the grip forces produced by the two subjects revealed that the grip forces underwent the same characteristic changes as the load forces. Thus, subjects were able to adjust grip forces in anticipation of arm movement-induced fluctuations in load force under different and novel load conditions. Adaptation to changing levels of gravity was also obvious when the vertical and horizontal movements were compared: grip forces depended heavily on movement direction during normal and hypergravity but not during microgravity. The predictive coupling of grip force and load force was observed even during transitions between gravity levels, indicating rapid adaptation to changing load conditions. To account for the striking preservation of the normal characteristics of grip force control, we suggest that a highly automatized, extremely flexible sensorimotor mechanism firmly implemented within the central nervous system can cope with even massive changes in the environmental conditions.},

abstract={Orbital microgravity represents a unique environment, which allows the isolation of variables assumed to be involved in the mechanism of body positioning in space. In this context, the alignment of the trunk axis along allocentric references and the positioning of the body center of mass inside the supporting base compete for the role of the primary-controlled variable when assuming erect posture. This paper reports the quantitative evaluation of the postural strategies exhibited by two subjects with feet fixed to the floor of the space module along a 4-month period of exposure to microgravity. With respect to previous findings in parabolic flights and short term space missions, the analysis focused on long-term process of sensorimotor adaptation to weightlessness. Results show that while trunk-axis orientation is preserved and used as a stable postural frame of reference, the positioning of the body center of mass appears to be significantly biased backward and turns out to be involved in a long-term process of adaptation throughout the entire flight towards the re-emergence of a typically terrestrial postural regulation compatible with equilibrium.},

We studied how pointing errors and visual localization of the target are modified due to adaptation to the horizontal body position; targeted movements to a real target were repeatedly performed during the adaptation period. Three types of experiments were performed: a basic experiment, and two different experiments with adaptation realized under somewhat dissimilar conditions. In the course of the first adaptation experiment, subjects received no visual information on the hand's position in space, and targeted movements of the arm to a luminous target could be corrected using proprioceptive information only. With such a paradigm, the accuracy of pointing to memorized visual targets showed no adaptation-related changes. In the second adaptation experiment, subjects were allowed to continuously view a marker (a light-emitting diode taped to the fingertip). After such adaptation practice, the accuracy of pointing movements to memorized targets increased: both constant and variational errors, as well as both components of constant error (i.e., X and Y errors) significantly dropped. Testing the accuracy of visual localization of the targets by visual/verbal adjustment, performed after this adaptation experiment, showed that the pattern of errors did not change compared with that in the basic experiment. Therefore, we can conclude that sensorimotor adaptation to the horizontal position develops much more successfully when the subject obtains visual information about the working point position: such adaptation is not related to modifications in the system of visual localization of the target. © 1999 Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers.},

abstract={Among the most critical issues in the design of immersive virtual environments are those that deal with the problem of technologically induced intersensory conflict and one of the results, sensorimotor adaptation. An experiment was conducted to support the design of a prototype see-through, head-mounted display (HMD). When wearing video see-through HMDs in augmented reality systems, subjects see the world around them through a pair of head-mounted video cameras. The study looked at the effects of sensory rearrangement caused by a HMD design that displaced the user's "virtual" eye position forward (165 mm) and above (62 mm) toward the spatial position of the cameras. The position of the cameras creates images of the world that are slightly downward and inward from normal. Measures of hand-eye coordination and speed on a manual pegboard task revealed substantial perceptual costs of the eye displacement initially, but also evidence of adaptation. Upon first wearing the video see-through HMD, subjects' pointing errors increased significantly along the spatial dimensions displaced (the y dimension, above-below the target, and z dimension, in front-behind the target). Speed of performance on the pegboard task decreased by 43% compared to baseline performance. Pointing accuracy improved by approximately 33% as subjects adapted to the sensory rearrangement, but it did not reach baseline performance. When subjects removed the see-through HMD, there was evidence that their hand-eye coordination had been altered. Negative aftereffects were observed in the form of greater errors in pointing accuracy compared to baseline. Although these aftereffects are temporary, the results may have serious practical implications for the use of video see-through HMDs by users (e.g., surgeons) who depend on very accurate hand-eye coordination.},

abstract={Accuracy and kinematics of horizontal arm pointing movements to visual targets were studied on three cosmonauts in 10-, 140-, and 172-d spaceflights in order to investigate mechanisms of the sensorimotor adaptation to microgravity. The Austrian equipment MONIMIR was mounted on board the Russian space station MIR and used for three-dimensional recording of the arm position and presentation of the targets. It was found that movement accuracy remained constant whereby movement durations significantly increased in all inflight sessions compared to the preflight baseline values. Inflight, movement peak velocities as well as acceleration and deceleration peak values decreased significantly. Analysis of the velocity-time profiles showed that the ratio between acceleration and deceleration phases decreased slightly for one cosmonaut and increased insignificantly for the other two cosmonauts. All phases of the acceleration-time profiles increased inflight by the same factor. These data fail to support the assumption of an increased role of the direct visual guidance in movement execution in microgravity. This suggests that the movement slowing in microgravity may be caused by a control strategy employed by the CNS to avoid the specific disadvantage of the absence of gravity. It is hypothesized that intra-movement control mechanisms play an important role in the movement coordination in the altered gravity environment.},

abstract={VISUALLY guided reaching requires complex neural transformations to link visual and proprioceptive inputs with appropriate motor outputs. Despite the complexity of these transformations, hand-eye coordination in humans is remarkably flexible, as demonstrated by the ease with which reaching can be adapted to distortions in visual feedback. If subjects attempt to reach to visual targets while wearing displacing prisms, they initially misreach in the direction of visual displacement. Given feedback about their reaching errors, however, they quickly adapt to the visual distortion. This is shown by the gradual resumption of accurate reaching while the prisms remain in place, and by the immediate onset of reaching errors in the opposite direction after the prisms have been removed. Despite an abundance of psychophysical data on adaptation to prisms, the functional localization of this form of sensorimotor adaptation is uncertain. Here we use positron emission tomography (PET) to localize changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in subjects who performed a prism-adaptation task as well as a task that controlled for the sensory, motor and cognitive conditions of the adaptation experiment. Difference images that reflected the net effects of the adaptation process showed selective activation of posterior parietal cortex contralateral to the reaching limb.},

Great efforts in order to get direct evidence failed, or were not accepted as direct proofs. A new facility was introduced with the structural analysis of intradendritic records of the PC. These records reveal a generally double (rarely single, triple or quadruple) rhythmic pattern of small spikes, which are proposed to be prespikes of dendritic origin. Moreover, they may take their origin at functionally separated dendritic compartments resulting in a nonlinear, phase-sensitive integrative process, performed by the compound spike generating mechanism of the cerebellar PC.},
